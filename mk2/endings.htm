Reptile has always loyally served as Shang Tsung's protector. While maintaining a very low profile in the first tournament, he discovered Tsung's plot to force the remaining members of his near extinct race into slavery under Shao Kahn's rule. Reptile then 
devises a plan of his own.<hr class="sub">

Upon learning of Sub-Zero's reappearance, Scorpion enters Shao Kahn's tournament. He witnesses Sub-Zero spare the life of an opponent and realizes that this is not the same Sub-Zero who murdered him so long ago. He lets the ninja live and goes on to defeat 
the Outworlders in their unholy contest.<hr class="sub">

<a href="ending_scorpion2.png" target="_self"><img alt="Ending 2" border="1" class="logo" height="250" src="ending_scorpion2.png" title="Ending 2" width="587"></a><br>

Earthrealm.<hr class="sub">

<a href="ending_subzero1.png" target="_self"><img alt="Ending 1" border="1" class="logo" height="250" src="ending_subzero1.png" title="Ending 1" width="190"></a><br>
When Sub-Zero failed to return from the Shaolin Tournament and rumor of Shang Tsung's survival reached the Lin Kuei clan, they immediately sent another assassin to complete the task. This new warrior is actually the younger brother of the original Sub-Zero.<hr class="sub">

<a href="ending_subzero2.png" target="_self"><img alt="Ending 2" border="1" class="logo" height="250" src="ending_subzero2.png" title="Ending 2" width="587"></a><br>
