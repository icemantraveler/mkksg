12/14/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Sorry for the delay, I've added Atom's info to the site. I was preoccupied with 
other projects and totally forgot about Atom's release. Big props for my buddy 
Chip who already had Atom downloaded. With his help I was able to document 
Atom's move list and try him out. Thanks Chip!<hr color="#333333">
11/15/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
I've added Hellboy's info to the site. He's pretty easy to learn, but it fits 
his character and it's almost a welcome change from more complicated move lists.<hr color="#333333">
11/11/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Fighter Pack 3 characters confirmed: Atom, Enchantress, and the TEENAGE MUTANT 
NINJA TURTLES; Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo!!!! Popularized by 
the first animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon series in 1987, and 
later the first live active Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie in 1990, many 
forget the Turtles origins as comic book characters from 1984. In a fighting 
game for comic book characters, nobody fits in better than these four turtles. 
It's unknown at this time whether each turtle will have his own spot on the 
character selection screen or function similarly to Tri-Borg from MKX, with each 
turtles sharing some Basic Moves with each other. Either way, I'm extremely 
pleased with this choice.<hr color="#333333">
10/08/17 - Today marks 25 years of Mortal Kombat. The first Mortal Kombat game 
was released in arcades across the globe on October 8th, 1992. Since then, what 
started off as an arcade smash hit has become one of the most successful 
fighting franchises in the history of video games. As of June 2000, the 
franchise had generated $5 billion in revenue, making it one of the 
highest-grossing media franchises of all time.<hr color="#333333">
10/04/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
I've added Raiden's info to the site. Atom has been offcially confirmed for DLC, 
I've added him and his bio info to the site. I would have had Raiden's info 
updated earlier, but Raiden is just a blast to play as, I ended up leveling him 
up the majority of the night.<hr color="#333333">
10/01/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Updated DLC Availability info for DLC characters. Raiden's expected to arrive 
this Tuesday.<hr color="#333333">

I've added Black Manta's info to the site.<hr color="#333333">
08/30/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Black Manta, Raiden, and Hellboy pics updated, Black Manta biography updated.<hr color="#333333">
08/23/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
DLC Fighter Pack 2 Confirmed Characters: Black Manta, Raiden, and Hellboy! Black 
Manta and Raiden came as no surprise for those that saw the shadows in the DLC 
Pack 1 trailer... Hellboy however was a bit of a surprise... Hellboy fits the 
NetherRealm Studios mold really well, an odd character, I wonder if he would fit 
better in the Mortal Kombat universe even though he's technically a comic book 
character... Either way, he's a welcome edition to Injustice 2, but I have to 
say as a Spawn fan I would have rather seen Spawn revealed.<hr color="#333333">
08/11/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a>

I've added the Injustice 2 Basic Moves and Combos to the site. Let me know if 
you spot any errors. Also, I've been working on fixing minor errors on the site, 
I've updated practically all the pages on the site, mostly unnoticeable changes, 
but some sections I've cleaned up.<hr color="#333333">
05/20/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default_xboxone.htm">Injustice 2 
Update:</a> Injustice 2 XBOX One guide completed, let me know if you spot any

inclusion for some time, however, we now have his official bio. Captain Cold and 
Green Arrow have been moved from Unconfirmed to Confirmed.<hr color="#333333">
03/04/17 - MKKSG Update: So if anyone has bookmarked
<a target="_blank" href="mortalkombat.co.nf">mortalkombat.co.nf</a> as the new 
web address for MKKSG &quot;Mortal Kombat - Komplete Strategy Guide&quot;, I want to 
apologize and let you know that after much consideration and an unpleasant 
experience with the new website host, I have decided to keep MKKSG on Angelfire, 
where it's been since 2003 or earlier when it was called the &quot;Mortal Kombat 
Deadly Alliance Unofficial Strategy Guide&quot;. It was born on Angelfire, it will 
perhaps die on Angelfire... But not anytime soon...<br>
I decided to move the site out of necessity, I was running out of disk space. 
I'm still running out of disk space, LOL. As of this moment the site is sitting 
on 19.6MB used out of 20MB total. That was the service offered by Angelfire when 
I signed up in 2003 or so. And I have managed to use that space for the last 14 
years without much hassle.<br>
What made me want to start the website in the first place was at the time I 
couldn't find any accurate movelists for MK Deadly Alliance on the internet at 
all, so I said, OK, I'll make one for myself. But after getting it set up I 
realized that it might come in handy for other fans of the series.<br>
But what started off as a guide for Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance eventually led 
into MK Deception, and then I started hosting my Mortal Kombat Sims skins for 
the original &quot;The Sims&quot; game. Man what a long time ago that was... The Sims 
Skins gave me a lot of attention back in the day, so I was under the impression 
that the site needed a gimmick to stay effective, so I tried a multitude of 
things before realizing that what people wanted and needed most of all was 
accurate movelists.<br>
So 14 years later, I think for the most part we have accurate movelists covered 
for the majority of the Mortal Kombat series.<br>
I know there's at least one person in the back saying, &quot;But you don't have MK3 
EXTRA 60 for NES, Turbo Mortal Kombat III for NES, or MK3 Mortal Kombat Special 
56 Pepoles&quot;... Yeah ok, if I wanted to be super meticulous, I could cover 
them... But no... Just no.<br>
So I started branching out and doing movelists for some of my other favorite 
fighting games, such as the ClayFighter series, Injustice, Killer Instinct, 
Primal Rage, and a few lesser known titles that I thought deserved a look at...<br>
And fans enjoyed that, however I felt like I was getting into a different 
territory with those guides that was outside the &quot;realm&quot; of Mortal Kombat. Pun 
intended. So I questioned myself. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;...<br>
8 Months ago I got my answer.<br>
I wish I could show it off now, however there's a few things I want to get 
worked out before showing it off, so stay tuned.<hr color="#333333">
03/04/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
We've had Dr. Fate listed in the confirmed section of Injustice 2 for awhile, 
and now he's finally been officially confirmed by Netherrealm Studios, so we've 
updated his temporary bio pic with his official one. Also, all confirmed 
characters with official bio pics have official bios from the Injustice 2 
website.<hr color="#333333">
02/20/17 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Cyborg and Scarecrow join the Injustice 2 roster. 5 slots left on the main 
roster... I've added Black Adam, Firestorm, Green Arrow, The Joker, and Mister 
Freeze to Unconfirmed along with Captain Cold... 5 slots, 6 unconfirmed... 
Hmm...<hr color="#333333">

update, if you find anymore, please inform us and we will try to add them to the

10/11/16 - Site Update: I'm aware of the updates/changes made to MKXL, I haven't 
had time to go through and add those changes to the site, hopefully I will have 
time to do so in the near future. Thank you for your patience.<hr color="#333333">
08/17/16 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Harley Quinn and Deadshot have been officially confirmed by Netherrealm Studios 
today. That brings the roster total to 12/28 confirmed character slots, so we're 
almost at the halfway mark of the known roster. Currently there is a pattern of 
character reveals, one returning character with one new character. If this trend 
continues, we're going to see 8 more returning characters from the first 
Injustice and 8 new characters. With 23 remaining characters from the first game 
not confirmed yet (not including Scorpion), it's a safe assumption that some 
characters from the first game won't be making the cut for the second iteration.&nbsp; 
Who won't be making the cut? Stay tuned to find out.<hr color="#333333">
07/22/16 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Wonder Woman and Blue Beetle have been officially confirmed by Netherrealm 
Studios today.<hr color="#333333">
06/11/16 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Injustice 2 has been confirmed, and we've documented 10, possibly 11 confirmed 
characters. Ed Boon has said that this game will have the largest roster of the 
dc games, so with Injustice starting off with 24 characters (before dlc), it's a 
possibility that Injustice 2 may have between 24-30 characters before dlc as 
well. As more info is revealed, it will be documented.<hr color="#333333">

03/16/15 - With less than a month left for Mortal Kombat X's arrival, I figured 
the time was right to update to Version 4 of our website. Almost every page on 
the site has been updated in time for MKX's arrival. The site is functionally 
the same, just did some error-checking, tried to get the movelists to better 
represent the in-game movelists (if available), sticking with official move and 
fatality names as much as possible, in process of editing some text for 
translation purposes (non movelist), added title tags to all the mugshots, I hid 
the ending pics and text from the ending sections, you now have to click on the 
+/- sign to expand endings, for people who want to avoid &quot;spoilers&quot;. Added 
Directional pics where it was appropriate, specially in the Codes sections. 
Compacted &quot;Bios&quot; and &quot;Story&quot; info together into simply &quot;Bio&quot; sections... I think 
that's it, but there's a few pages that I need to add links for, I'll get to 
it... Stay Tuned!<hr color="#333333">
03/13/15 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Jason 
Voorhees Konfirmed for MKX DLC. The first of 4 DLC kharacters to be announced 
part of the Kombat Pass. We know that 1 other of these DLC kharacters will be a 
guest kharacter, and the other 2 will be returning MK characters. Stay Tuned.<hr color="#333333">
03/12/15 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Added a few 
characters to the Konfirmed section, added a few characters to the rumored 
section, updated a few mugshots, added a few bios (Which may or may not be 
final), 6 more characters to be konfirmed until we reach the 24 kharacter mark 
which was the amount of kharacters the select screen had available, however 
there have been reports that the select screen may not be final, and the roster 
may be closer to 30 kharacters, it's unknown at this point in time... again, the 
rumored kharacters mugshots are from the MKX game itself, however the game has 
been said to have &quot;Hundreds&quot; of cameos in the story mode, so the likelihood of 
every single kharacter shown being on the roster is unlikely. More updates 
coming soon...<hr color="#333333">
02/24/15 - On the 15th of this month, the site became 13 years old. I also 
celebrated my birthday on that day, and from that and Valentine's Day 
altogether, I would have to say that this Birthday was one of the best that I've 
had in a long time.&nbsp; My wife actually bought a bunch of games for me about 
a week before my Birthday, (GameStop sale) and so I had told her not to worry 
about getting me anything for my Birthday because there wasn't really anything 
that I needed or wanted...<br>
I already had Mortal Kombat X reserved and paid off (originally for the XBOX 
360)...<br>
I'm a budget gamer, I love finding deals on games, I love picking up games for 
$10 or $15 that usually run $30 or $45, and I'm talking physical copies, no 
digital bullmess.&nbsp; I was on the fence about this whole &quot;Next-Gen&quot; thing...<br>
Well there was a few games that my wife wanted for the XBOX One, and we had 
talked about spending some money on a new system, so we made the trip down to 
our local GameStop and picked one up.&nbsp; Changed my pre-order of MKX for the 
360 to the XBOX One.<br>
Got Alien: Isolation and Dead Rising 3 with it.&nbsp; So far having a blast.<br>
We actually got snowed in that night that we got home from purchasing the XBOX 
One, (Sunday), and did not get out until the following Sunday, so we had a lot 
of time to put into gaming, and also into some DVD seasons of some shows that we 
managed to get for a great price.<br>
So far I am really impressed with the XBOX One, having a few gripes with some 
decisions that the XBOX team made in terms of menus, and the size of some game 
updates. (20 F'N GIGS?!?!?)...&nbsp; But overall, having fun with it.<br>
<br>
So the gameplan is, getting the XBOX One version of MKX possibly early April 
14th,<br>
Updating and correcting the movelist for the XBOX version, then converting it 
into Universal and PlayStation versions.<br>
Sometime after that will try to work on PDF versions.<hr color="#333333">
02/13/15 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Added more 
movelist info.<hr color="#333333">
02/06/15 - <a target="_blank" href="combos.htm">Combos:</a> I updated the
<a href="combos/mk5.htm">MK Deadly Alliance combo page</a> with SOME 
information, however I'm extremely weak at MKDA, I haven't played it in forever 
and the combo system is different than Deception or Armageddon... If anyone 
could <a href="mailto:trav.lane84@gmail.com?subject=MKDA Combos">submit combo

01/14/15 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Kitana 
confirmed in newest MKX gameplay trailer.&nbsp; I have yet to add her to our MKX 
section, but I will as soon as I am able... Like Kung Lao, her inclusion in MKX 
and her negative reaction to Quan Chi raises many questions that we hope are 
answered in MKX.<br>

12/31/14 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Kung Lao is 
confirmed (leaked) for MKX on New Years Eve. He has an aged look and a new 
Razor-Bladed hat design in one of his variations. Having been killed by Shao 
Kahn, and his soul seemingly under Quan Chi's control in MK2011, his appearance 
in MKX raises more questions than answers concerning MKX's storyline and Kung 
Lao's own motivations... <hr color="#333333">
12/20/14 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Still working 
on site updates, it's a lot of work, but I'm making good progress, I've also 
been focusing on the MKX section a lot in the last few days, been finding a lot 
of MKX movelist info here lately, however obviously these moves are untested and 
are possible to change before MKX's April release. More to come!
<hr color="#333333">
11/07/14 - Did anyone else see
<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/529781586040864769">
this tweet</a> by Ed Boon?&nbsp; Not only is it a funny pic, but if you look 
close enough you may see some variations of mug shots exclusively made by 
myself.&nbsp; These include MK1 Reptile, MK2 Smoke, Jade, Noob Saibot, and Shao 
Kahn, MKT Chameleon, Khameleon, and Smoke. These mugshots were made for 
characters that did not have mugshots that I needed for website purposes, or in 
situations where the originals were too low of quality to match the others.<br>
Pretty kewl to see this on Ed Boon's page even if it wasn't originally made by 
him.<hr color="#333333">
10/20/14 - With time to kill until Mortal Kombat X's arrival, I am working as 
fast as I can to get a few more sections completed, I have started on what I 
feared to be a monumental task, one that I have been putting off since the 
beginning of the site... It is difficult, and time consuming, however once it's 
done, I'm positive that it will be worth the effort... To be continued in the 
near future...<hr color="#333333">
10/02/14 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Quan Chi 
confirmed for Mortal Kombat X! We have updated Quan Chi's bio section with a 
little bit of storyline info, not his official bio as of yet. More info will be 
revealed at a later date...<hr color="#333333">
09/06/14 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Goro 
confirmed as DLC for Mortal Kombat X with pre-order, and the current release 
date of Mortal Kombat X has been revealed as April 14th, 2015!<hr color="#333333">
08/04/14 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Kano leaked 
for MKX.<hr color="#333333">
06/19/14 - <a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> Added 
information concerning the button layout of MKX, it is similar to MK2011, 
however the throw button has been moved, and the tag button replaced with a 
stage interact button.<hr color="#333333">
06/02/14 - It Begins Again.<br>
<a target="_blank" href="mk10/default.htm">MKX Update:</a> The New Konfirmed 
Kharacters for MKX are officially named: D'Vorah (The bug lady), Ferra / Torr (Ferra 
is the girl riding and apparently controlling the monstrous Torr), Kotal Kahn 
(The Neon Aztec), and Cassie Cage (The apparent offspring of Johnny Cage and 
Sonya Blade).<br>
The kharacter roster has been confirmed to hold 24 kharacters at present, 
however from covering past releases of MK games, we here at MKKSG can predict 
with a good bit of certainty that the final roster number will be between 25-30, 
not counting the boss kharacter or DLC... Speaking of bosses, Ed Boon has stated 
that the boss of MKX would be a returning past kharacter, and that their 
appearance would surprise most fans. A lot of internet rumblings have mentioned 
Raiden or Liu Kang as possible boss kharacters... However I wouldn't rule out 
Shinnok, Quan Chi, or possibly even Shang Tsung... I can say with most certainty 
you can rule out Shao Kahn as the final boss...<br>
As far as the storyline goes, it has been stated that MKX will take place 
directly after the events of MK9/MK2011, and up to 25 years into their future, 
explaining the appearance of Johnny and Sonya's aged love child.<br>
Gameplay footage of MKX has revealed the &quot;Choose Variation&quot; option for each 
kharacter that was mentioned in the press release, basically when you choose a 
kharacter, you can then choose at least 3 variations on the kharacter, which 
will affect available special moves, weapons, and unique attacks. Each variation 
has minute detail changes to the kharacter's outfits, no mention of secondary 
outfits as of yet...<hr color="#333333">

05/08/14 - I am currently working on another guide to an older game, I actually 
have 3 other guides on the backburner, plus another game that I would like to do 
a guide on... It's good when you have time to kill... Unfortunately, I don't 
have much free time nowadays... I'm hoping to have at least one more guide out 
before Netherrealm Studios announces it's next game (which supposedly is taking 
place next month). I'm also having trouble with my internet provider, I was with 
one company for 10+ years, then changed, and now I may be forced to change 
again. I will continue to update the site as best I can. I would love to start 
taking requests for fighting game guides from fans, but unfortunately, my plate 
is a little full at the moment...<hr color="#333333">
05/04/14 - Updated War Gods with official move names, as well as adding a few 
missing moves for some characters, and extra information that was not previously 
made available. Still have a bit of cleaning up to do with the formatting 
however. Did get a chance to test the PC version of the game out. Not bad with 
the OpenGL plugin installed.<hr color="#333333">
05/01/14 - Added guide for Justice League Task Force Genesis Version... The Poor 
Man's Injustice! LOL.<hr color="#333333">

I have also added info on the <a target="mkmain" href="clayfighter/cf1te.htm">
ClayFighter</a> games, but I haven't added them to the main site yet.&nbsp; I am 
missing some information for these games, if anyone is able to fill-in any

please contact me.&nbsp; Sorry for delay in updates, not much news on the MK 
front.&nbsp; Stay Tuned.<hr color="#333333">

update: Scorpion should now be available to download for everyone, regardless of 
whether you purchased the season pack or not. Scorpion... E for Everyone...<br>
Also managed to get my XBOX 360 replaced (It went RROD), this one came with an 
HDMI port, so whoo-hoo for &quot;true&quot; HD graphics!!<br>
Also Killer Instinct was recently announced for the XBOX One. It looks like more 
of a remake than a sequel, only time will tell, if you're into Killer Instinct, 
we may eventually do a movelist for the new one, although I highly suggest 
checking out our friends over at

update: Finally got Scorpion's official Character Power and Super Move's 
descriptions, thanks to Juliet Starling from Facebook.&nbsp; Juliet also helped 
with Scorpion's Special Moves as well, since my XBOX 360 decided to have 
technical difficulties during Scorpion's arrival.&nbsp; I would have had this 
updated sooner but I'm suffering from bronchitis.&nbsp; Some days you just can't

06/04/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>

he's available on the PlayStation Network, or will be later today, not sure when 
they update.<br>
<br>
A lot of people are having trouble downloading Scorpion, and some people who are 
able to download Scorpion and the skins pack are experiencing problems with the 
Doomsday and Superman Darkest Knight skins, including XBOX 360 freezes.<br>
<br>
Note: I believe Scorpion is included with either the Containment Suit Doomsday 
Skin which was 164.86MB or the compatibility pack AS LONG AS YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY 
PURCHASED THE SEASON PASS.<hr color="#333333">

being DLC for Injustice, I have gotten their sections ready for when their 
eventually announcement is made. If I'm wrong, I can always change it... Also

05/25/13 - Printable Documents section updated, basically moved all PDF's to 
Google Docs and updated the links... Going to be adding some new docs as soon as 
I get a chance.<br>
Ironically, I wanted to move everything to Google Docs to save space and 
bandwidth, but the mortalkombat.co.nf servers wouldn't wait on me, and the site 
is temporarily out due to &quot;bandwidth overuse&quot; so yeah, my bad.<br>
Google Docs is having trouble displaying some of the PDF files correctly, you 
should download the files directly to your hard drive if you intend to print 
them. I'll try to contact them later. <hr color="#333333">
05/23/13 - Going to be doing some work to the Printable Documents section (When 
I get the chance), looks like we're going to be using &quot;Google Drive&quot; aka &quot;Google 
Docs&quot; from now on for PDF storage, to save on storage and bandwidth. It's 
somewhat of a chore, but will be worth it in the end. I will also try to get 
some more PDF files created and uploaded, such as SNES versions of the Classic 
MK games, etc. <hr color="#333333">
05/21/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>

04/27/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Lobo (DLC) confirmed release date: May 07th 2013. Lobo uses his chains 
as grapplers similar to Scorpion and Batman, I believe there may be two 
variations he uses, he uses a move similar to Superman's Low Scoop, and he also 
has a Shotgun projectile attack. His bike appears in his intro, his outro, as 
well as in his Super Move, where he uses the flame exhaust to put the burn on 
his opponent. <hr color="#333333">

I'm not sure how it made it's way into the code, I know how to fix it, it's just 
going to take awhile. It's on my &quot;to do&quot; list. Lobo confirmed as #1 DLC

04/17/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Injustice XBOX 360 Move List updated. Made a few corrections and 
additions to the buttons. Currently the Universal Guide is incorrect since I 
figured out that they had ditched the High, Mid, Low attacks with Light, Medium, 
and Heavy, so I will have to correct that ASAP. I will convert the XBOX 360 
version into the other versions soon, too tired to get to it tonight, so if 
there is any info that you would like me to add to the sections, now is the time 
to let me know. <hr color="#333333">

Lists updated. I am getting my copy of Injustice later this evening, and will 
make updates and modifications to the movelist as needed. I apologize for the 
delay, and I apologize for any errors that may be present in the current 
movelists. Check back later today or tomorrow, should have everything sorted by 
then, as well as PDF versions of the movelists. <hr color="#333333">

Lists updated. I am suffering from a small injury to my right foot sustained 
yesterday, hopefully it will not slow me down during Injustice's Release.
<hr color="#333333">
04/08/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>

Official Bios, All Special Moves, All Character Traits, and All Super Moves. 
Character Traits and Super Moves are also &quot;clickable&quot;, with more descriptive 
information available for most, look for the +/- symbol for expanding info.<br>
I have yet to update the &quot;Alternate Inputs&quot; page, however I am planning on doing 
that soon enough.<br>
Like I'm stated before, nothing is tested yet. Going to be doing tests myself on 
the 16th. Injustice is a Week away. <hr color="#333333">
04/08/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>

update: Movelist updates for Ares, Bane, Doomsday, Hawkgirl, Killer Frost, 
SHAZAM!, and Sinestro, however like I'm stated before, keep in mind nothing is 
tested yet. Injustice is 9 days away. <hr color="#333333">
04/03/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
slight update: Corrected a few inputs, had Throw and Environmental Interactions 
switched... I also had to disable right clicking on the Injustice pages because 
I had seen a few pages pop up on the interwebs with my movelist copy and pasted 
into forums and whatnot... I don't have a problem with my work being &quot;spread 
around&quot;, however I am updating the movelists quite frequently, and since I don't 
want the tubes cluttered with outdated information, I am requesting that if 
users do want to share my information, please just share the link. I apologize 
for any inconvenience this may cause.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Injustice, have you played the demo yet? Got a chance to play it on 
the XBOX 360 with my buddy Blade, and I have to tell you, Gameplay Vids do not 
do the game Justice... &quot;Gameplay Vids do Injustice an Injustice&quot;... anyhoo... 
Yeah, the game looks great, the environments and characters really pop out, and 
the animations and cinematics are top notch...<br>
<br>
Gameplay wise, the game feels like a good balance of MK and SF'ish mechanics, 
leaning ever so slightly more in the MK direction (Which is a good thing, trust 
me). The face buttons house the 3 Attack Buttons, (High, Mid, Low), and your 
character trait button, whose function changes depending on the character. At 
first I was suspecting that placement of the Character Trait button was a bad 
idea, and when first picking the game up, I accidentally hit it trying to attack 
at one point, but this was quickly rectified and did not happen again. My buddy 
Blade was quick to do the same thing playing as Luthor. Directional throws 
worked good but lacked variety, and the Environmental Interaction button was 
hard to trigger at times. Stage transitions were initiated by holding Back and 
the A button, which started a charge type attack which felt like it took 
forever. The overall speed of the game is faster than MK (IMO) and maybe even 
faster than SF4 (Been awhile since I played that tho...) So anyone complaining 
about the game being too slow - totally unfounded. At times it even seemed like 
the game was too fast, jump attacks felt a little clunky at times, and Wonder 
Woman's floating felt odd. The Super Moves were easy to activate, however the 
Special Meter IMO was a bit hard to read. The Clash/Wager System didn't appear 
very often, and when it did, it totally confused me, my attention was directed 
at the characters, and not the meter, so I had no idea what button I was hitting 
to do what, lol. When I have more time I will try to go into more detail with 
that system, figuring it out myself in the process... Pausing the game brought 
up the special moves for the character... but not the entire special move 
list... You actually have to dig deeper into the menus to find the entire 
movelist... And you could also activate special moves to appear on your screen 
during gameplay... but only 6... and Luthor for instance had more than 6 
moves... Weird. (Good thing you have my guide to use right?... Right.) Um... 
Yeah, so that was what I picked up from the demo, and although most of what I've 
listed may seem negative, I have to say that the game is VERY FUN to play. Blade 
(playing the game first) beat the Demo with Batman, and I beat the Demo with 
Wonder Woman, and then we took turns with Luthor. After that, I went through the 
movelists of each character, and then made a playthrough with Batman myself. If 
anything, the Demo makes me want to play the full game even more.
<hr color="#333333">
04/02/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Batman, Lex Luthor, and Wonder Woman movelists updated from the Demo. 
Have you tried it by the way? AMAZING. <hr color="#333333">
03/29/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a>

<a target="mkmain" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=526245097428110&set=a.390552734330681.95824.364971353555486&type=1">
Injustice</a> demo: April 2 on PlayStation Network (America), and April 3 on 
PlayStation Network (Europe) and Xbox LIVE Marketplace.<br>
<br>
The free demo for Injustice: Gods Among Us will feature Batman, Wonder Woman, 
and Lex Luthor, battling in the Gotham City arena.<br>
<br>
<a target="mkmain" href="igau/default_ps3.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> update: 
I have updated Injustice's PS3 section for the demo release, all moves are yet 
untested at this point and are subject to change on release, but I will make 
changes and additions as soon as I'm able to test the game myself, I will of 
course be using the XBOX 360 version.<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that if you customize your controls for Injustice then the 
only guide that will work for you is the <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">
Universal</a> one, so please do not contact me with &quot;This move says X when it 
should say Y or Trinagle/Circle, whatever. If you customize your movelist then 
my console movelists will not work for you. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Also, if you have to send me messages asking asking &quot;What does U, D, F, B 
mean?&quot;, you will probably get an automated response from me describing in detail 
the reasoning behind using that method as opposed to using Arrow Commands, and I 
promise you it will be very long and very boring, and you probably won't read 
half of it, ultimately learning nothing in the process. So please. If you read 
the &quot;Key&quot; section, just below the Mugshots, you should see a detailed 
explanation of what U, D, F, B means, and if you can't progress from that point, 
then there is nothing I can do to help you in the slightest. That goes not just 
for the Injustice section, but any and all MK sections, and life in general.<br>
<br>
Now for those of you who are determined to use the &quot;Alternate inputs&quot; WITHOUT 
EVEN TRYING the &quot;Default inputs&quot; and for those who prefer the Arrow based 
system... Don't fret, there will be a special section for you as well. Complete 
with graphic inputs and buttons. I just feel for you if you're on the right side 
of the screen, since the arrow based system is only appropriate if you're 
constantly on the left side... <hr color="#333333">
03/28/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Movelists updated. Updated some missing buttons commands for Black Adam, 
updated Raven's Movelist.<br>
After considerable thought, I have decided that <u>IF</u> the &quot;Alternate Inputs&quot; 
for Injustice are different enough from the &quot;Default Inputs&quot;, I will include 
them in the Injustice guide in some format. Whether that be alongside the 
default movelist or tucked away in a hidden table, who knows. More than likely, 
the &quot;Alternate Inputs&quot; may get their own page, to keep the default movelists 
uncluttered.<br>
The &quot;Alternate Inputs&quot; will however be included in the PDF version of the 
movelist, which will come a few days after the initial movelist is updated, 
giving time for any corrections that may appear. <hr color="#333333">
03/26/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Movelists updated. Updated some missing buttons commands for a few 
characters, updated Joker and Deathstroke's Movelists.<br>
<hr color="#333333">
03/24/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Partial Aquaman movelist found.<br>
03/24/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Partial Lex Luthor and Black Adam movelists found.<br>
<br>
It is becoming difficult to identify accurate movelists with Injustice giving 
players the ability to customize their buttons. Why anyone would substitute an 
attack with a face button for an attack with a shoulder button is beyond me, but 
more power to them... Also saw a FEW movelists with Street Fighter controls 
turned on, basically transforming &quot;D, F&quot; into &quot;D, D/F, F&quot;, basically 
over-complicating the movelist... I MIGHT try to include THOSE TYPE of moves 
into a guide somewhere... But I highly doubt it.<br>
<br>
Let's just be real about it, whether you tap or roll &quot;D, F&quot; you cannot do it 
without passing &quot;D/F&quot;. It's inevitable, but it's totally irrelevant as well, 
even without the diagonal buttons listed, it's totally compatible, so why 
over-complicate it? <hr color="#333333">
03/23/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Some movelists updated, the newest version of the game shown at PAX 2013 
had slightly different movelists for Superman and Batman, mainly rearranged and 
renamed moves. I was also able to get Green Lantern's movelist.<br>
<br>
03/23/13 Update - Ares and Killer Frost Confirmed. Those two have been hinted 
and teased for awhile now but have finally been verified. That leaves the 4 DLC 
characters, one of which is heavily implied to be Martian Manhunter.

<hr color="#333333">
03/20/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: I have updated a few of the movelists, added some extra info, updated 
the XBOX 360 section, as well as having edited the PS3 and Wii U pages. A good 
portion of the movelist is available, however it has yet to be &quot;field tested&quot;.<br>
If I had not stated before, I am expecting to get the Injustice game for XBOX 
360 sometime on April 16th, hopefully at a Midnight release, and before I go 
head-first into story mode, I will be going through the Special Moves, Character 
Traits, Super Moves, and possibly Bios (if they're available) for all 
characters, making additions/corrections as I see them.<br>
The XBOX 360 section will be updated first, followed by the Universal section, 
and finally the PS3 and Wii U sections.<br>
I will give the html guides time to &quot;simmer&quot; and see if any additional 
corrections need to be made. When I get the point where I think the guides are 
good, I'll make PDF files for each version of the game, more than likely in a 
few days after the game is released.<br>
<br>
If your section is not readily available on the release date, I apologize, 
bookmark it and stay tuned. <hr color="#333333">
03/19/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Black Adam Officially confirmed!<br>
<hr color="#333333">
03/15/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Added Black Adam to confirmed section, there is a pic floating around of 
him on the character select screen in his primary costume, as well as a pic of 
his Injustice action figure.<br>
Raven is listed with the heroes in the leaked character select screen (which 
still had 24 character slots), which separates Heroes from Villains, so if you 
take that into account, you can look at the roster like so:<br>
<br>
<b>Heroes</b>: Aquaman, Batman, Cyborg, Flash, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, 
Hawkgirl, Nightwing, Raven, Shazam, Superman, and Wonder Woman. (12)<br>
<b>Villains</b>: Bane, Black Adam, Catwoman, Deathstroke, Doomsday, Harley 
Quinn, Joker, Lex Luthor, Sinestro, and Solomon Grundy. (10)<br>
<br>
Leaving two slots open on the Villain's side.<br>
<br>
The leaked Injustice Achievement List which revealed Raven also revealed another 
character which so far has yet to be identified, many people are saying that it 
is Killer Frost, which is possible, remember that in Injustice's teaser trailer 
we never did see Captain Cold fighting The Flash, only ice being used as a 
weapon, so she's possible.<br>
<br>
Another rumored character is Wonder Woman's arch villain Ares, the God of War.<hr color="#333333">

03/09/13 - Yesterday my fiance surprised me by giving me a receipt for the 
Injustice Collector's Edition pre-order. She is so amazing. If my store does a 
Midnight Release, I'm going to try to go, and first thing I want to do is go 
through and correct the Move List so I can update the site, so it will be 
available to everybody. Hopefully it will be ready shortly after release, or 
possibly the day after, updating the main pages first, followed by pdf files.
<hr color="#333333">
03/06/13 - Black Adam confirmed for Injustice?... Not quite, however he does (or 
someone very similar) appear in
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=vDtD2_WPmGQ&hd=1">Lex 
Luthor's Story Trailer</a> released on youtube.&nbsp; Allied with Hawkgirl, this 
character flies after Lex, shooting lightning from his hand, and wears a 
slightly Ancient Egypt themed black and yellow outfit with a lightning bolt over 
one shoulder.&nbsp; Oh and he's bald...&nbsp; His appearance in story mode does 
not automatically guarantee his spot on the playable roster though, so we will 
have to wait and see. <hr color="#333333">
03/01/13 - It's the first of March, just a reminder that
<a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> is set for 
release next month on April 16th for North America, Australia, and Europe, 
followed by a Japanese release on June 9th, so if you're interested in 
purchasing Injustice, be sure to pre-order at your local videogame retailer. 
Speaking of pre-orders:<br>
<br>
Pre-orders from EB Games, GameStop, and Game gives players access to the Red Son 
Pack, a DLC pack inspired by the Superman: Red Son comic book limited series, 
containing alternate Red Son skins for Superman, Wonder Woman, and Solomon 
Grundy, and 20 additional missions set within the Red Son storyline.<br>
<br>
Pre-orders from Wal-Mart carry the Arkham City Skin Pack, containing 
downloadable costumes for Batman, Catwoman, and the Joker, and a bonus copy of 
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.<br>
<br>
Offers from Best Buy include a new Batman skin, based on the Blackest Night 
storyline, and an exclusive &quot;zombie mode&quot;.<br>
<br>
In addition to the standard edition, the Collector's Edition is available for 
purchase for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, which includes a steelbook case (UK 
only), a collectible figurine, a digital download code for the animated film 
Justice League: Doom (US only), two issues of the Injustice comic book series, 
and three exclusive costumes for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman based on 
their appearances in The New 52. The North American and European versions of the 
bundle offer different figurines. The North American release offers a 13-inch 
(33 cm) statue featuring Wonder Woman fighting Batman, while the European 
release offers a smaller 9-inch (23 cm) statue of the two locked in battle.<br>
<br>
The Battle Edition, exclusive to GameStop and EB Games, includes a light weight 
fight stick controller and the three DLC skins.<br>
<br>
In the United Kingdom and Australia, the Special Edition is available, 
exclusively through EB Games, containing the steelbook and the Red Son Pack.
<hr color="#333333">
02/25/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Sinestro and Hawkgirl confirmed!<br>
02/26/13 - I didn't have much time to update the site when I found out about 
Sinestro and Hawkgirl, so my apologies for a rushed update. I have since had 
time to go back and include more information for Hawkgirl than what was 
originally available. Sinestro was hinted at months prior, Hawkgirl however 
honestly took me by surprise. That brings the total number of confirmed 
playables, (Doomsday included) to 20. That leaves 4 character slots open right? 
Well... maybe not. Been hearing rumors of the shown character select screen not 
being the final version, and that the roster may well exceed 24 playable 
characters. Raven and Black Adam's chances are looking pretty good now, been 
hearing rumors of more female characters to be announced...<br>
<br>
Like I said, Sinestro was a likely inclusion, I was surprised by Hawkgirl's 
inclusion, we have 4 character slots left over out of the previously confirmed 
24 playable characters (which may end up being larger)... This is no man's land. 
I have a feeling we're in for a few surprises.<br>
<br>
<u>Random stats for comparison:</u><br>
MKvsDC Playable characters: 20, Bosses: 3, DLC Characters: 2 (Cancelled)<br>
MK2011 Playable characters: 27, Bosses: 4, DLC Characters: 4<br>
<br>
Also possible Gorilla/General Grodd?... Grodd?? Why not Zod???

02/13/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update:
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/02/13/injustice-gods-among-us-aquaman-reveal-trailer">
Aquaman Officially Confirmed</a>.<br>
They said he was useless... They said his powers were stupid...<br>
Ok so I was not expecting Aquaman to be revealed today, however he has been 
sitting in Injustice's Unconfirmed section for months now.<br>
As much as it confuses me, I have to give the Netherrealm Studios props for 
making a character as silly as Aquaman appear so intense in this videogame.&nbsp; 
I'm actually not worried about the rest of the roster at this point.<br>
If they can make Aquaman look bad-ass and interesting, then they can make
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beppo_(comics)">Beppo the 
Super Monkey</a> the final boss and I would still pay cash money for this game.<hr color="#333333">
02/13/13 - SHAZAM! has been officially confirmed, no surprise considering the 
&quot;leaked&quot; render... Ed Boon said and I quote: &quot;New character announce tomorrow. 
And its a BIG one! Really big!&quot;... Most ppl are quick to say Doomsday, however 
I'm going out on a limb and saying that Damian Wayne will be announced tomorrow. 
If anyone has been keeping up with the Injustice comics, Damian Wayne appears on 
the front of Injustice #5 alongside Flash, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Green 
Arrow, and Nightwing... And he's apparently allied with Superman.
<hr color="#333333">
02/10/13 - Supposedly, a new Playable Character for Injustice is going to be 
revealed Monday. Doomsday and Captain Marvel aka SHAZAM! Are the only 
&quot;confirmed&quot; characters to be yet &quot;Officially Confirmed&quot; by NRS, so it could be 
one of them, but then again, there are a few slots left filled on the Injustice 
roster, we may be surprised...<br>
Check back for updates tho!<br>
Also, did anyone else notice that Deathstroke and Green Lantern have yet to be 
added to the official Injustice Character's page??? Wassup wit dat NRS?
<hr color="#333333">
02/08/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Added Killer Croc to Unconfirmed section of Injustice. There is a 
picture floating around of the Flash being attacked by Killer Croc, accompanied 
by The Riddler and The Penguin. Supposedly Ed Boon is going to confirm or deny 
Killer Croc's playability status tomorrow... However I've noticed that both 
Penguin and Killer Croc, and even the stage itself resembles their &quot;Arkham City&quot; 
counterparts, so my best guess is that this is a screenshot from the &quot;Arkham 
City&quot; mission packs included with Batman, Joker, and Catwoman skins.<br>
Update: Apparently Killer Croc's appearance in Injustice is limited to being a 
stage transition in the Arkham Asylum arena, which is inspired heavily by the 
Arkham Asylum/City games, using Arkham City versions of Killer Croc, Penguin, 
Riddler, and Two-Face, which COULD mean that these characters are not going to 
be among the Roster when the game is released. (However with DLC, anything is 
possible.) <hr color="#333333">
02/05/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Elaborated on some bios. Captain Marvel aka SHAZAM! confirmed for 
Injustice.&nbsp; Captain Marvel is the last character carried over from MKvsDC, 
and is the 17th (16th if Doomsday turns out to be a Sub-Boss) confirmed 
character for Injustice.&nbsp; As a favorite of Ed Boon, Captain Marvel's 
inclusion into Injustice was expected.<hr color="#333333">
01/31/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Updated character pics and some bios, not sure if they're final yet, 
updated a few links, most link now to dccomics.com. <hr color="#333333">
01/19/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Updated Injustice countdown timer date to April 16th 2013.
<hr color="#333333">
01/18/13 - I figured with all the updates on Injustice, Killer Instinct, and 
other non-MK related materials on the site, someone might want some MK related 
updates, so I took it upon myself to do a Longplay of
<a target="mkmain" href="mksf/default.htm">MK Special Forces</a>, one of MK's most 
overlooked titles.<br>

01/16/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Doomsday added to confirmed section. Also hearing reports of Aquaman, 
Captain Marvel aka Shazam, and Sinestro being confirmed as well, however I 
cannot confirm them myself, yet... <hr color="#333333">
01/08/13 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Bane and Lex Luthor confirmed. Lex Luthor is another character carried 
over from MKvsDC, as the arch villain of Superman, his inclusion was expected. 
Bane, who's popularity had a slight &quot;Rise&quot;, having been portrayed by Tom Hardy 
in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; was also expected by fans... However truth be told, 
even though both confirmations were not a big surprise, they are both welcome 
additions to the Injustice roster.<br>
All DC characters that appeared in MKvsDC have been confirmed for Injustice save 
for one: Captain Marvel... A fan favorite of Ed Boon.<hr color="#333333">

<hr color="#333333">
11/28/12 - <a target="mkmain" href="igau/default.htm">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a> 
update: Deathstroke confirmed. Being another character carried over from MKvsDC, 
Deathstroke's inclusion was no surprise to us at MKKSG, as he has sat in the 
unconfirmed section since July. Gameplay wise, he is similar to his MKvsDC 
version, using both sword and guns in his attacks, but looking much more fluid 
and combo oriented with Injustice's game mechanics.<br>
Interestingly, All DC characters that appeared in MKvsDC have been confirmed for 
Injustice save for two: Captain Marvel and Lex Luthor... <hr color="#333333">
11/28/12 - <a target="mkmain" href="ki/main2.htm">Killer Instinct 2</a> as well 
as <a target="mkmain" href="ki/default_gameboy.htm">KI for GameBoy</a> pages have 
been error checked and updated by yours truly. If any errors or additions need 
to be made, please contact me. <hr color="#333333">
11/16/12 - C-C-C-Combo Breaker! <a target="mkmain" href="ki/default.htm">Killer 
Instinct</a> and <a target="mkmain" href="ki/main2.htm">Killer Instinct 2</a> 
arcade pages are up, as well as <a target="mkmain" href="ki/default_gameboy.htm">KI 
for GameBoy</a>. A lot of the moves are currently untested, and I need to work 
on getting official names of moves, and adding information on the mechanics of 
the games.&nbsp; If anybody's willing to help out with this, please
<a href="mailto:trav.lane84@gmail.com">contact me</a>, I'm adding a credits 
section to the end of each game page. <hr color="#333333">
11/09/12 - Our forum is temporarily down for unknown reasons. It's been 
reported, so hopefully we'll have it up again soon... <hr color="#333333">
10/16/12 - Thinking about making a <a target="mkmain" href="ki/default.htm">Killer 
Instinct</a> guide for the site, focusing on Killer Instinct/Killer Instinct 2 
and Killer Instinct Gold for Arcade/Super Nintendo/Nintendo 64, and GameBoy...<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I am not familiar with some of Killer Instinct's play mechanics 
and would be at a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
So I'm stuck finding some fans of KI that know the game well, that can help with 
the movelist.<br>
<br>
I was hoping the movelist could be simplified, similar to my MK movelists for 
the casual player, however containing details that hardcore players would be 
searching for as well.<br>
<br>
If you're interested in helping, you would be given due credit on the page 
itself, honestly I am probably not going to be able to do this on my own with my 
unfamiliarity with the games. Please <a href="mailto:trav.lane84@gmail.com">
contact me</a> if you're interested in helping with this project.
<hr color="#333333">
10/13/12 - Added Green Arrow Render to Injustice Renders section.
<hr color="#333333">
10/12/12 - Added Martian Manhunter and Robin to Unconfirmed section of 
Injustice.<br>
<br>
12 of the 24 characters have been revealed, trying to use my brain to figure out 
the remaining 12 characters, 9 of which I'm about 90% sure of their inclusion... 
So that leaves 3 characters that I'm unsure of, unless the roster size 
changes... But honestly with the number of DC Universe characters available, and 
the uncertainty of the roster size, any guesses made at this point would be 
grasping at straws... <hr color="#333333">
10/11/12 - Injustice update: Green Lantern and The Joker confirmed.
<hr color="#333333">
10/09/12 - Injustice update: Green Arrow confirmed. Green Arrow's movelist is 
primarily consisting of &quot;...you guessed it...&quot; arrow based attacks, one in 
particular uses the Bow itself as a weapon.<br>
Two more characters are expected to be revealed tomorrow, however since I will 
be out of town, the updates may be slightly delayed.<br>

Added Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection (MK, MKII, UMK3), and MKvsDC Finishers 
List for the XBOX 360 and PS3
<a target="_blank" href="printable_movelists/index.htm">Printable Documents</a> 
(Arrow Format). Also updated MKDeception Printable Movelist Universal (Arrow 
Format), and MKUnchained Finishers (Arrow Format). <hr color="#333333">
09/22/12 - MK Mythologies Items page updated. <hr color="#333333">
09/21/12 - In the last two days I have beat MK Special Forces, and have gotten 
to the last level of MK Mythologies: Sub-Zero... While the games are still fresh 
in my mind, I am adding/editing their sections as I see fit... I'm planning on 
making a proper Walkthrough for Special Forces, and updating some pics/info for 
Mythologies. These two games were a radical step for the MK creators From the 
standard fighting game, and although some people criticize Mythologies' 
difficulty, or Special Forces rushed nature... I highly suggest playing them and 
experiencing them for yourself.<br>
<br>
I'd stay away from MK Advance tho... but just in-case you're into that specific 
type of torture, we have a guide for that too... <hr color="#333333">
09/19/12 - Updated MK Armageddon XBOX, PS2, Wii (Wiimote/Nunchuck, Classic, and

09/10/12 - In the Fan-Made section, I have updated a few moves on the UMKT page 
and fixed the Rom/Emulator link for MKR. <hr color="#333333">
08/29/12 - Completed work on the Side Games/Fan Made/Others sections. If I have

08/28/12 - Did some work to the 2D game sections to help readability. Added a 
new background few days ago.<br>
Update: Finished updating most of the 3D game sections to help readability. 
Still need to work on the Side Games/Fan Made/Others sections.
<hr color="#333333">
08/15/12 - Injustice update: Another of MKvsDC's characters is confirmed for 
Injustice: Gods Among Us: Catwoman is confirmed.
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXp0e9xSwDs&feature=player_embedded">
Link to Catwoman Trailer..</a> Her moves remind me of Freddy Krueger's from 
MK2011, sporting razor claws, a whip, and a Rocket Launcher... Wait what??? 
(LOL, Rocket Launcher is a background weapon that characters can use)
<hr color="#333333">
07/22/12 - I changed the way the Arcade Kollection page works, and added the 
Midway Arcade Treasures 2/Extended Play page. For those awaiting Injustice, I 
have also added &quot;Justice League: Task Force&quot;, in our new game section, &quot;others&quot; 
and although ScrewAttack listed it as number 9 on their &quot;Top 10 Worst Fighting 
Games&quot;, I have to point out that they were reviewing the Genesis version of the 
game, which was made by a different developer and is nothing like the Super 
Nintendo version, which is worth a glance in my opinion. <hr color="#333333">
07/18/12 - Injustice update: I'm a bit hesitant to upload the new version of the 
Injustice page, as the information that I've collected has no way of being 
verified (and it's huge)... A few days ago I listed Raven as an unconfirmed 
character, but now I have received conflicting info... info which possibly 
identifies the remaining 8 characters, however Raven was not among those 
listed... but oddly, she was the only character who did not conflict with the 
new information... So my guess now is that either Raven was based off of &quot;bad 
info&quot;, or Injustice may possibly have more than 24 &quot;selectable&quot; characters. By 
comparison, MK2011 had 27 Selectable Characters (Including Kratos), 4 DLC, and 3 
Bosses, not to mention, a handful of secret characters thrown into the Tower 
Missions...<br>
<br>
So... for the moment I am delaying adding this new info to the site and am 
awaiting confirmation on at least 2-4 of these listed characters before I add 
them to the Injustice section.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I don't want anybody 
getting disappointed over bad info.&nbsp; Even if they are listed as 
&quot;Unconfirmed&quot;.&nbsp; I will list some highlightable info, but even these 
&quot;spoilers&quot; will be written as vague as I can manage.&nbsp; And keep in mind that 
this game is still in development, and this info has not been confirmed yet:<br>
My Unconfirmed Info (highlight to read):<br>
<font color="#000000">1.) DC Roster from MKvsDC all return.&nbsp; (Only unlisted 
was Darkseid, who is still a Boss or Sub-Boss possibility).<br>
2.) 2-4 Unlockable Characters: Captain Marvel and Deathstroke are potentially 
unlockable, as well as 2 Unlockable Kharacters from Mortal Kombat.<br>
3.) Joker, unfortunately is a day one DLC pre-order bonus followed by 3 more 
characters throughout the year in an attempt to sell a season pass.<br>
4.) All alternate costumes are on disc, but are going to be locked for DLC, with 
a few given with the Joker pre-order.<br>
5.) Martian Manhunter, Booster Gold, Plastic Man and Hawkman appear throughout 
the story, but are not playable. An eternally burning Martian Manhunter set on 
fire by Batman is a boss in the story mode who uses EDITED moveset/animations 
and a melted monstrosity version of Plastic Man is a boss as well who used the 
moveset of EDITED.</font><br>
<br>
Update 03-22-13: With the inclusion of Joker and Raven as playable characters, 
it is likely to say that this information was incorrect.<hr color="#333333">
07/12/12 - Injustice update: Added Cyborg and Nightwing to the list of Confirmed 
Characters, moved Joker and Lex Luthor to Unconfirmed, as well as adding Aquaman 
and Green Lantern to Unconfirmed. I'm sure people who are following Injustice 
have seen the &quot;leaked&quot; Aquaman and Green Lantern Concept Arts which I cannot 
confirm or deny are real, they looked &quot;legit enough&quot; to warrant their inclusion.<br>
So, if my data is correct, and if they are aiming for a 24 character playable 
roster (Possibly not including bosses and Hidden characters), half of 
Injustice's Roster is now listed.<br>
<br>
Update: Added Captain Cold, Deathstroke, Green Arrow, and Raven to the 
Unconfirmed section. I was a bit hesitant to list Captain Cold with the 
abundance of &quot;Ice Based&quot; characters that could have fit the part...
<hr color="#333333">
07/07/12 - Updated the Main Index, Frames Menu, Portable Devices, and Main 
pages. I really like the new organized Frames Menu page, should make it easier 
for PPL to find what they're looking for. <hr color="#333333">
06/30/12 - Added MK2011 Printable Finishers (Arrow Format). <hr color="#333333">
06/29/12 - Tweaked the JavaScript Navigation a bit. <hr color="#333333">
06/26/12 - Added MK 1, 2, and 3 Arcade/Home (Universal)
<a target="_blank" href="printable_movelists/index.htm">Printable Document</a>s 
(Arrow Format). <hr color="#333333">
06/25/12 - Updated MK2011
<a target="_blank" href="printable_movelists/index.htm">Printable Document</a>s 
(Arrow Format). <hr color="#333333">
06/08/12 - Added some new information about Injustice to it's appropriate 
section... I have to say, the more news I hear about Injustice... The more I am 
disappointed. I understand that they want change. But 3 attack moves and an 
environmental button? Marvel vs Capcom tried it and it didn't really work... 
Holding Back to Block?? That's original... I would go into the innumerable 
reasons for a block button, but I'll simply say that NEW is good, but RECYCLING 
obsolete mechanics is a step back IMO.<br>
<br>
I was in a store today... I won't name names, let's just say it's an evil 
megalomaniacal corporation bent on world domination and low prices... and 
behold, Street Fighter VS... X... Cross... Whatever... Tekken was in the gaming 
department. $40. I was like... &quot;This is out??? When did this happen??? And 
$40??&quot; I just laughed and shook my head. Do we really want to follow THAT route? 
Seriously? ...Seriously???<br>
<br>
From the developers of Mortal Kombat, I am expecting Mortal Kombat for 
Injustice. You want it to be great, it has to resemble greatness. You want to 
follow the old and dated mechanics? Be prepared for the bargain bin.<br>
<br>
MK(2011): GameRankings: 85.64%/Metacritic: 86/100<br>
SFvsTekken: GameRankings: 83.84%/Metacritic: 84/100<br>
<br>
The numbers don't lie. <hr color="#333333">
06/05/12 - Continuing to add info to the Injustice page as it becomes available.<br>
<hr color="#333333">
06/01/12 (Part 2)- Updated the &quot;<a target="_blank" href="printable_movelists/index.htm">Printable 
Document</a>s&quot; page, mainly putting both formats on the same page, currently 
only the UDFB movelists are complete, still need to work on the Arrow Movelists. 
I'll get on that as soon as I have some time. Stay Tuned.<br>

05/02/12 - To the best of my knowledge, MKVita uses the same movelist from the
<a target="_blank" href="mk9/default_ps3.htm">PS3 version of MK2011</a>.&nbsp; When 
using the touchscreen for fatality input, you only have to motion the 
directional input of the fatality.&nbsp; Meaning taking Sub-Zero for example, 
where his &quot;Have an ice day&quot; fatality is B, F, D, F, <font color="#FF0000">O</font>, 
you just motion &quot;B, F, D, F&quot; on the touchscreen and the fatality is performed.&nbsp; 
Not for sure if distances/direction are still a factor with the touchscreen.<br>

03/14/12 - Mortal Kombat 4 and Gold added to the Arrow System Movelist page.<hr color="#333333">
03/09/12 - Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance and Deception added to the Arrow System 
Movelist page.<hr color="#333333">
03/06/12 - I am not a fan of the arrow system that most sites use, since they 
don't translate well when fighting from right to left, however since a lot of 
fans believe them to be easier to read, I've been working on converting my 
movelists into that system, complete with system and universal versions.
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/va3/mk/printable_movelists/index2.htm">
Enjoy</a>. More Koming.<hr color="#333333">
02/27/12 - I have updated the majority of the Move Lists, converting them to PDF 
format, so now the pages are already pre-organized and print neater. I have also 
added &quot;Printable Finisher&quot; pages for the majority of the MK games, located on 
the <a target="_blank" href="printable_movelists/index.htm"></a>
<a target="_blank" href="printable_movelists/index.htm">Printable Document</a>s</a> 
page. I have also consolidated the Hand-Held sections into the main sections for 
easier viewing, and have simplified the Java-Based Navigation of the site. 
Hopefully this helps with navigation and Printing of the Move Lists if so 
desired.<hr color="#333333">
02/16/12 - MK News has been slow, but we are poised to deliver the best 
information regarding Mortal Kombat (2011 Vita) as soon as said information is 
available to us. Oh, and yesterday the site became 10 years old. Yay! Lol.<hr color="#333333">
01/17/12 - Mortal Kombat &quot;Komplete Edition&quot; is being (re)released for the XBOX 
360 and PS3 systems, &quot;Komplete&quot; with all the DLC bonuses included on disk, as 
well as a copy of the first MK Movie, due out on Feb 28th 2012.<br>
<br>
Mortal Kombat is also being released on the PS Vita system with all DLC Bonuses 
as well as Kratos, and some additional features due out sometime in Spring 2012.<br>
<br>
Mortal Kombat for PS Vita was previously codenamed &quot;Mortal Kombat Vitality&quot; and 
used a logo similar to MK Mythologies: Sub-Zero.<br>
<br>
I have added a Universal Printable Finishers List to the MK2011 section.<hr color="#333333">

<hr color="#333333">
12/19/11 - I have never really been satisfied with how the MK Armageddon Krypt 
page layout was, so I completely remade it. It now functions identically to the 
MKD, MKDA, MKDA(GBA), MKTE(GBA), and MKU(PSP) krypt pages... That's a lot of 
Krypts...<hr color="#333333">
12/07/11 - I have restructured the JavaScript Navigation on the pages, so now 
you select your Game from the drop down menu, and then when you reach the game 
you want, when you go back to the navigation bar, it will only show your current 
chosen game's specific sections, until you click on the link at the bottom of 
the Navigation Bar to go back to the main page and select another game. This 
keeps the sections less clogged up and confusing. Certain games have been 
grouped together, such as the many iterations of UMK3, the three side games, and 
the three Fan-Made Genesis Hacks to name a few. I will eventually reorder the 
Frame Based Navigation page, possibly grouping the Hand-Held versions with the 
main games. Hopefully with this update, operating the site on Portable Devices, 
or just without Frames will be much easier.<hr color="#333333">
11/14/11 - Still doing work on getting information concerning Button Info for 
different Systems. If you believe I am missing button inputs for certain ports, 
let me know and I'll try to find that info and add it to the site.<br>
<br>
As always, if you spot errors, PLEASE, PLEASE, inform me.<br>
<br>
Slight Gaming Blurb: With <b>Saints Row: The Third</b> on the horizon, I have 
been trying to get the little stuff on the site taken care of... as well as 
completing over 90% on both <b>Saints Row</b> 1 and 2, and finding new life in 
games such as <b>Fable 3</b>. I'm a huge fan of the <b>Grand Theft Auto</b> and
<b>Saints Row</b> Series, and I'm anxious to see where the story (Yes there is a 
story intertwined with the Nude Skydiving) is going. Also an amazing friend of 
mine is purchasing <b>WWE '12</b> for me, and I'm sure to be pouring time into 
that game as well with a never ending supply of Chair-shots to John Cena's 
noggin. And then we have <b>Mass Effect 3</b> just around the corner. I know a 
lot of people have hopped aboard the <b>M.E.</b> bandwagon since the second 
game, I was one of the people who purchased <b>Mass Effect</b> 1 simply from 
knowing Bioware's track record with games such as <b>Star Wars: Knight of the 
Old Republic</b> and <b>Jade Empire</b>, so I've been there since the beginning 
and am eagerly awaiting the third arrival.<br>
So yeah a few eagerly anticipated games on the horizon, but expect me to 
continually check in when I'm burnt out on whatever game I'm playing at the 
moment, and if there's anything I can improve upon, I will try.<br>
<br>
What games do you play? Let me know in the forums.<hr color="#333333">
11/08/11 - Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance for GameBoy Advance slightly adjusted, 
movelist added. Was thinking about merging the portable MK's in with the main 
MK's to organize the sections better, I'm still debating... Still doing work on 
getting information concerning Button Info for different Ports. Check the Mortal 
Kombat II Move List/Bios Page to get an idea of what I mean.<hr color="#333333">
10/22/11 - If you notice any and or all of the printable pages turning blue in 
just a few moments, that is normal... Doing some minor alterations... Going to 
be updating the MK2011 Sections soon, nothing major, just some restructuring. 
You might have also noticed some minor additions to some of the games concerning 
the Default Button Configurations of several iterations of the MK games for 
several different platforms. I just figured well... Why not. Keep in mind that 
some movelists for the MK1-UMK3 games for Sega Genesis involving the 3 Button 
Pad may be different than with the 6 Pad, I may be able to work that out at a 
later date...<br>
<br>
As always fans, enjoy the site, and drop me a line when you can with comments 
and/or suggestions, help is always appreciated and credit is always given.<hr color="#333333">
10/10/11 - Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance for GameBoy Advance finally uploaded, 
Movelists/Bios as well as a Sortable Krypt page. Also changed the look of the

10/09/11 - Mortal Kombat Trilogy Sections updated and uploaded. Sorry for the 
Delay. Let me know if you notice any errors.<hr color="#333333">
10/08/11 - I'm <u>hoping</u> to get the MK Trilogy sections updated and uploaded 
by Around 2 or 3ish EST. Along with this update is going to be a slightly 
altered appearance, nothing major, just a better looking font IMO. After that 
I'll be experimenting with adding an appearance changer to give users multiple 
appearance styles to choose from.<hr color="#333333">
10/05/11 - Had some delays with some updates however have most of the MK3 Home 
Versions have been updated (Main site as well as 2 Player Section and Printable 
Pages) a few move corrections, elaborations, as well as some re-structuring. I 
have moved the stage fatalities to the bottom of each character's section for 
easier reference, as well as more info concerning distances. Even if there is no 
distance requirement I am now adding (Anywhere) just to avoid confusion. Again, 
still working on MK Trilogy section.<hr color="#333333">
09/26/11 - Most of the updates to the 2D sections (Both Main Site and 2 Player 
Pages) are complete. Still need to work on MK Trilogy's section.<hr color="#333333">
09/22/11 - Still working on updates to the 2D sections. Getting close to 
Kompletion... If you notice any errors concerning the UMK3 section concerning 
the XBOX 360 or PS3 versions, please let me know.<br>
<br>
Also, be sure to check out<br>

Printable Movelists by Johannes</a><br>
who has used my site to create a PDF MK2011 Printable Movelist. It's pretty neat 
in my opinion, so check it out. I'll add this site to my Links section soon.<hr color="#333333">
09/15/11 - Updated the MK1 and MK2 sections, mainly some cleanups and a few 
additions. After I updated these sections, it occurred to me that I could add a 
few more details here and there, as well as simplifying the layouts a bit, so 
I'm re-working the 2D game sections. (MK1-MKT). Also trying to go through UMK3 
Movelist to make sure it's compatible with the XBOX 360 version. So still a bit 
to do, and my weekend is probably going to be hectic, so probably looking at 
sometime mid next week before I get everything updated and uploaded.<hr color="#333333">
09/11/11 - Added a Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection section for simplicity's 
sake. Going to be doing an update on the MK1 section concerning distances as 
soon as I can. Been sick for the last 2 weeks. I was working on simplifying the 
navigation frame with drop down text, however I was having trouble getting it to 
work correctly in Opera and Chrome.<hr color="#333333">
08/10/11 - MK2011 Updates: Goro, Kintaro, and Shao Kahn's Movelists updated with 
more Finisher inputs.<hr color="#333333">

08/05/11 - MK2011 Updates: Retro Outfits available with the Freddy Krueger DLC 
Combatibility Pack have been Confirmed as being &quot;Klassic Sub-Zero&quot; and &quot;Retro 
Cyber Sub-Zero&quot;.<br>
&quot;Klassic Sub-Zero&quot; is a mixture of his Unmasked MK3 look and the UMK3 Sub-Zero 
costume, which personally I think looks great, complete with his MK3 scar down 
his eye...<br>
&quot;Retro Cyber Sub-Zero&quot; is a palette-swap of the previous Klassic skins for both 
Sektor and Cyrax that we have seen before, however fans have been asking for an 
alternate kostume for him for some time. Personally I think it adds an nostalgic 
factor to the kharacter, he looks almost identical to the kharacter &quot;Hydro&quot; that 
we've seen in Fan Based games of Mortal Kombat.<br>

07/22/11 - MK2011 Updates: We have the move-list Freddy used during his

07/14/11 - I have been working on the MK Unchained Krypt Guide section, there 
was quite a few differences from MK Deception in terms of Krypt Kontent and a 
few Locations/Times, it's enough to make somebody pull their hair out, so if you 
notice an error, PLEASE inform me so I can make corrections.<br>
With a few reviews and possible revisions, I would like to post this guide on 
GAMEFAQS because they are lacking a Krypt Guide for MK Unchained for the PSP, 
but I want to iron out any possible kinks first.<br>
Also keep in mind that you can sort the tables by clicking on the Koffin, 
Unlockable, and Price/Location cells at the top in grey, which works on all of 
our Krypt Guides now, save for Armageddon, which I'm planning on working on 
next.<br>

section with his full bio, and added some more info to his moveset.<hr color="#333333">
07/11/11 - I updated Kenshi's Ending in both low and high bandwidth ending 
pages, added Rain's render to MK2011 Render page, and added info on some of 
Rain's moves to his bio section. Rain is scheduled for a July 19th release... 
But I'd keep July 20th open on my schedule... Just incase, lol.<hr color="#333333">
07/09/11 - Rain Render Released. We had an awful lightning storm, and my Modem 
was struck by lightning. Luckily, I am still able to use my secondary computer, 
and will be rectifying the situation shortly. In the meantime, updates MAY be 
affected, however I'll bring everything up to speed when I get a replacement for 
my Modem, and possibly a few Ethernet Ports...<br>
(Should I be blaming Rain or Raiden for the Lightning Storm???)<br>

07/06/11 - Minor Updates/Corrections made to Kenshi's MK 2011 Movelist. Finally 
had a chance to download and play as Kenshi for the XBOX 360... I'm not a huge 
Kenshi fan but he serves his purpose. Most fans have been impressed with his 
overall performance in MK. I'm a little mixed, I was more impressed with Skarlet 
in terms of Gameplay and Storyline. Still waiting on Rain!!!!!<br>
<br>
Also... The &quot;Mysterious&quot; Kharacter (DLC #4) has yet to be revealed, I'm guessing 
either Fujin or Tanya.<hr color="#333333">
07/05/11 - Kenshi's Movelist is up for the MK2011 section, still awaiting info 
on his Enhanced Specials, and still waiting for his arrival on XBOX Live...<br>

please find Kenshi and direct him to XBOX Live Please? K, thank you...<br>
We now have Kenshi's full Movelist up, as well as his Concept Art and Render.<hr color="#333333">
06/30/11 - Added Release Date Information to DLC Kharacters and uploaded 
Kenshi's Fatality Wallpaper.<hr color="#333333">

also added the secret koin locations for MK2011 that I forgot to add before... 
Also added Skarlet's Fatality Wallpaper.<hr color="#333333">
06/28/11 - MK2011 Sortable Krypt page is now online, that's 4 Krypt pages in 4

06/21/11 - Skarlet's moveset is now available, however it is untested, so if you 
notice an error, inform me immediately. Kenshi and Rain now have short bios. The 
Xbox Dashboard is also running a promotion for the new DLC and Season Pass, it 
reveals that Kenshi and Rain will be available in July, and the mysterious 
fourth DLC character will be available in August. Along with Kenshi and Rain in 
July there will be FREE new retro skins for Noob Saibot and Smoke released, 
which appear to be based on their MKII appearances, rather than the MK1 
appearances of the previous retro ninja outfits. Also don't forget that the 
compatibility pack for Skarlet comes with Retro Cyrax and Sektor outfits.<br>
<br>
Official Press Release:<br>
<br>
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and NetherRealm Studios are excited to 
announce the Mortal Kombat Season Pass which will offer Mortal Kombat fans an 
added incentive to buy all four new Add-on warriors at one time for a reduced 
price instead of when purchasing them individually. The first Mortal Kombat 
downloadable warrior, Skarlet, will be available for download starting June 21st 
and will be followed by Kenshi, Rain, and an unannounced new entrant to the 
Mortal Kombat tournament! Each warrior will come with a full move set, a ladder 
arcade story ending and two fatalities.<br>
<br>
Available for purchase starting June 21st, the Mortal Kombat Season Pass will 
allow users to buy all four downloadable warriors as a package for 1200 
Microsoft points. Each individual warrior can be purchased when they release for 
400 Microsoft points. Each warrior will become unlocked for download as they 
become available throughout the summer.<br>
<br>
Further, in order to allow for seamless online play with the new downloadable 
warriors, free compatibility packs will be required to download with the release 
of each new warrior. As an added incentive, each compatibility pack will come 
with two FREE klassic skins, the first of which are being released with Skarlet 
will be Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 inspired Cyrax and Sektor. Gamers who purchase 
the Mortal Kombat Season Pass (or individual Add-on content) will automatically 
get the free klassic skins when they download each warrior. Those who do not 
purchase the Mortal Kombat Season Pass or the Add-ons, will be able to download 
the compatibility packs for free and have access to the klassic skins as well.<br>
<br>
Please note: The Mortal Kombat Season Pass is only available for purchase on 
Microsoft's Xbox LIVE. PlayStation users will also have full access to the 
individual DLC warriors (for $4.99), the compatibility packs, and the FREE 
klassic skins.<hr color="#333333">
06/17/11 - Rain, as well as a yet unrevealed kharacter has been confirmed as 
being DLC for Mortal Kombat 2011. Skarlet has been confirmed as being available 
for download on June 21st, as well as a free compatibility pack which contains 
Klassic Kostumes for Cyrax and Sektor. Kenshi has been announced too however his 
release date is currently unknown.<br>
That makes 4 total confirmed kharacters as DLC for MK2011: Skarlet, Kenshi, 
Rain, and an unknown Kombatant.<hr color="#333333">
05/27/11 - Mortal Kombat Klassic Skins Pack DLC:<br>
<iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ECe5eMO6fWw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe><br>
Available for download on Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store for 
$4.99 (or 400 Microsoft Points) on Tuesday June 7th, 2011.<br>
<br>
The collection consists of seven pre-order klassic character skins for Sub-Zero, 
Scorpion, Reptile, Ermac, Mileena, Jade and Kitana and klassic fatalities for 
Reptile, Scorpion and Sub-Zero.<hr color="#333333">
05/27/11 - Added a few new renders/concept sketches. Still waiting on higher 
resolution shots for some images.<hr color="#333333">
05/25/11 - Updated MK2011 Krypt with some missing information, as well as 
redoing the printable Krypt.<hr color="#333333">
05/23/11 - Corrected Johnny Cage's Babality. Was one movement off. For those who 
have printed out the movelist already, it is F, B, F, BK (Jump).<hr color="#333333">
05/20/11 - Added Alternate Outfits to Renders section of MK2011. Still waiting 
on Primary Outfit Renders for some characters.<hr color="#333333">
05/12/11 - In Mortal Kombat (2011)'s first month of release, the game sold over 
1 million copies. By comparison, Super Street Fighter 4, Street Fighter 4, 
Marvel vs Capcom 3, Virtua Fighter 5, and Tekken 6 each sold less by comparison 
in their first month of release. A true testament to the dedication of the MK 
Fan. Also in issue 218 of Game Informer, they gave Mortal Kombat (2011) a rating 
of 9.5. A rating that the majority believe should have been IGN's score for MK 
as well. All in all, a good time to be an MK Fan.<hr color="#333333">
05/10/11 - Added Updates section to main Index Page, as well as added links to 
the 2 Player section, as well as a link to &quot;Portable Devices&quot; which is made from 
the 2 Player pages, but lacking the secondary &quot;2 Player&quot; page.<hr color="#333333">
05/07/11 - Restructured the 2 Player pages.<hr color="#333333">
05/06/11 - Added info on the Hidden Fighters to the main pages of MK2011.<hr color="#333333">
05/04/11 - Added some info on the MK2011 DLC Skarlet to the site, as well as 
making some small modifications to the layout of the MK2011 sections, as well as 
the printable movelists. You can find Skarlet's VS Pose in her section, it's not 
the same resolution as the originals, but it is not bad quality.<br>
<br>
Additional Update: High Bandwidth MK2011 Endings section now has some activity 
on it. Go check it out!<hr color="#333333">
05/02/11 - Added MK2011 Goro, Kintaro, and Shao Kahn's accurate Movelists to the

04/21/11 - Welp. I was hoping I could get the Moves done tonight. I added Raiden 
and Ermac's Babalities. All we need is Baraka, Kabal, and Noob Saibot. If you 
find em, let me know. I'm out. Peace.<hr color="#333333">
04/20/11 - Updated MK2011 Movelists yet again with some more additions and 
corrections. Every Finisher has been tested out personally by myself. Distances 
have been corrected. Some Special Moves updated as well. Still need to go 
through entire movelist for corrections. If you notice a mistake, please let us 
know.<hr color="#333333">
04/20/11 - Updated MK2011 Movelists yet again with some more additions and 
corrections. So far we have everyone's known fatalities, and stage fatalities. 
Missing a good portion of the babalities. If anyone has any knowledge on Baraka, 
Ermac, Kabal, Noob Saibot, Raiden, plus Goro, Kintaro and Shao Kahn (If 
Applicable)'s babalities, please fill us in.<br>
<br>
Additional Update - We now have Scorpion, Sindel, and Sonya's Babalities as well 
as Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Reptile's Classic Fatalities listed thanks to &#321;ukasz 
Kaczmarek's support.<br>
<br>
I just finished printing my copy of the movelist, and it's already outdated, lol.

<br>
Update 04/20/11 - Kelcey has sent us another file extracted this time from the 
PS3 Demo Version of MK2011. This file was leaked some time ago during the 
agonizing wait for the release of MK2011. This version of the file however has 
been formatted for easier reading.<br>

04/18/11 - MK2011 Updates: MK2011 Updates: Printable Movelists updated with 
Incomplete info. All Fatalities listed however. Oh and Krypt Area updated. I 
think I missed like 4 or 5 koffins but I couldn't figure out which ones. If you

<br>
New Update: Special Moves have been updated, Minor Corrections Needed, then 
testing.<hr color="#333333">
04/16/11 - MK2011 Updates: Added some Fatalities to their appropriate sections. 
Hopefully I'll get the movelists up sooooon...<hr color="#333333">
04/13/11 - For those wondering, yes we will have XBOX 360 and PS3 specific 
versions of the FULL MK2011 Movelist, as well as a Universal Version compatible 
with both versions. I highly recommend using the Universal Movelist and getting 
used to the FP/BP commands as it has that nostalgic MK feel to it. I may even 
make a version using the oldschool HP/LP commands for the true MK purists.<hr color="#333333">
04/11/11 - MKII Section updated with some missing info that I have been 
overlooking for quite some time. Makes me wonder how I ever got the Dead Pool 
Fatality working back in the day... Also been updating info on some of the Stage 
sections. Such as MII-MKT.<hr color="#333333">

<br>
I have been looking for High Quality MKDA and MKDeception Endings for a LONG 
time, and unfortunately have been unable to acquire them myself.&nbsp; 
Player_One has taken it upon himself to rip not only these pics but large 
portions of the MKDA and MKD Krypts.&nbsp; He has allowed my site to display 
these pics, and out of respect I am linking to his site.&nbsp; Check his site 
out, it's awesome.<br>
<br>
Currently only the MKDA endings pics are uploaded minus Mokap and Blaze.&nbsp; 
The rest (MKD) will be updated as they're available.<hr color="#333333">

04/02/11 - Sorry for the lack of updates, I have updated the MK2011 section with 
new Mugshots, VS Poses, Arenas, One new trailer, and have organized the 
Kharacters into different sections such as Unlockable, Bosses, and DLC. Also 
added Kenshi to the roster from MKDA fame who is supposed to be one of the first 
Downloadable Kharacters for the game koming in the near future.<hr color="#333333">
03/24/11 - I apologize for lack of updates, I will be unable to make updates 
until first of next month, but hopefully by then I will have something extensive 
to update.<hr color="#333333">
03/18/11 - MK2011 Kabal information elaborated on, as he was &quot;revealed&quot; by 
GameTrailers TV. This was the first footage we have seen of Kabal for MK2011, 
even though his appearance in the game was &quot;leaked&quot; around December of last year 
or even earlier. Kabal was a popular addition to MK3 when it debuted in '95, and 
since MK2011 is a &quot;retelling&quot; of sorts for the first 3 MK games, Kabal's 
inclusion in the new game came as no surprise.<hr color="#333333">
03/17/11 - MK2011 Raiden GamePlay video uploaded to our MK2011 Trailers section.<hr color="#333333">
03/16/11 - MK2011 Demo Printable Movelist is available and is compatible with 
the PS3 Demo of the game which is available now on the PS Network, as well as 
the XBOX 360 Demo which has yet to be released.<hr color="#333333">
03/10/11 - MK2011 Raiden Vignette uploaded to our MK2011 Trailers section.<hr color="#333333">
03/09/11 - Welcome to &quot;Version 3&quot;. What's New? Many sections have been 
implemented with drop down menus, streamlining the game sections for movelist 
use. If you see a &quot;+/-&quot; symbol, it means that you can click it for more 
information. The plus side to this is less clutter for the movelist purists, and 
less spoiling of unknown materials. I'm going to be adapting this drop down 
system for Endings section soon. Starting with Mortal Kombat (2011).<br>
Another thing you will notice is our drop down menu bar at the top of most of 
the Site's pages. This allows for people that navigate in from Google and can't 
find our index page to easily navigate the site. You can use it with the frames 
as well if you so choose.<br>
A rather large yet almost unnoticeable addition is the stylesheets that I've 
installed. Basically I can change the look of the entire site by changing one 
file. And the last &quot;majorish&quot; update is the work on the Movelists. I have 
reordered moves on the movelists in terms of when the move was given to the 
kharacter (MK1, MK2, etc.) and I tried as hard as I could to make sure that 
Sub-Zero's &quot;Ice Freeze&quot; move was always referred to as &quot;Ice Freeze&quot; and so 
forth. Makes reading the guides easier. Also the printable movelists are now 
dated (at the bottom) from the last update they received. So yeah I hope you 
enjoy the updates and I hope you continue to stop by the site. Feel free to drop 
me a line sometime. I don't mind some input from time to time.<br>
<br>
I also want to thank my Girlfriend for supporting me, giving me the inspiration 
to get the site cleaned up, and putting up with me during my late night code 
binges. We actually sat down one day and played MK Shaolin Monks til we beat 
it... Yup. She's a keeper. ;)<hr color="#333333">
03/09/11 - MK2011 Section updated... All Bios have been released, however they 
are hidden in our drop down menus. Do not click on them unless you want to be 
spoiled.<br>
Continuing to work on &quot;Version 3&quot;.<br>
<br>
Also, MK2011 Raiden and Kung Lao Renders updated, Jade Render 2 uploaded, some 
basic info updated.<hr color="#333333">
03/07/11 - MK2011 Renders section updated with Kung Lao. Kung Lao render is 
identical to the &quot;Concept Sketch&quot; that was uploaded earlier, but much better 
quality. Raiden's second &quot;Shadows&quot; Wallpaper has been released and looks 
awesome. MK2011 Movelists have been updated. Cage's bio has been elaborated on 
but I'm doubtful that bio will be his final... You will also notice that Quan 
Chi has been moved to the &quot;Hidden Kharacter&quot; section (I was right! Haha!) along 
with &quot;Skarlet&quot; and 2 other Kharacters... One unrevealed as of yet, and could be 
one of the previously announced Kharacters, Smoke maybe?... and the other was 
rumored for MK2011 a long time ago, but now he's all but Konfirmed... I'm still 
in shock of this discovery and I'm interested in how they're going to pull him 
off, I'm not going to spoil it here, but he's been listed anyway for accuracy's 
sake on the MK2011 page. So that leaves the Konfirmed Kharacters at 25, Hidden 
at 4, and Bosses at 3, Totaling 32 Kharacters so far.<hr color="#333333">
03/05/11 - MK2011 Renders section updated with Ermac, Jade, and Goro. Goro and 
Ermac have been seen before, but not in this quality, and the Jade render is 
new. You will also notice that the MK2011 movelists have been updated slightly 
with info from the new gameplay videos released at Gamespot. Also notice that 
I've updated the MK2011 page to include drop down information, I'm implementing 
this into the entire site soon. Remember that if you see +/- it means that you 
can click on it, and information will drop down. This keeps the storyline info 
out of the way of the movelist info.<hr color="#333333">
02/28/11 - MK2011 Raiden Shadows Fatality Wallpaper Released. You can find it in 
our Wallpapers Section, and there is also a link to it in the MK2011 Section at 
the end of Raiden's section.<br>
<br>
Still working on &quot;Version 3&quot;.<hr color="#333333">
02/25/11 - Some Fatalities/Kharacters have been leaked for MK2011.&nbsp; If you 
don't want to know them, then don't highlight the text below.<br>
<br>
Also, I am about 95% certain that my Konfirmed Roster for MK2011 is Komplete.&nbsp; 
That being said, I am now highly doubtful that Rain or Motaro will make an 
appearance in MK2011, however &quot;never say never&quot;.<br>
<br>
From the leaked/discovered paperwork concerning Australia's Banning of Mortal 
Kombat 2011, it was stated that the game will start off at 25 playable 
characters from the start with an unknown number of unlockables.<br>
<br>
Right now my Roster sits at 26 Characters +Skarlet +Goro + Kintaro +Shao Kahn 
(Totaling 30).&nbsp; So one of my &quot;Konfirmed&quot; Kharacters might actually turn out 
to be unlockable, as they've all been konfirmed in one way or another...&nbsp; 
My guess is that either Smoke or Quan Chi will end up as Unlockable.&nbsp; My 
bet being Quan Chi.<br>
<font color="#808080">Highlight - &gt;</font><font color="#000000"> Stryker tasers 
his opponents and then explicitly shoots their head off with his gun. Blood and 
gore is noted.<br>
- Shao Khan uses his hands to explicitly rip an opponent’s body vertically in 
two<br>
- Jade explicitly kicks an opponent into the air and plants her fighting stick 
into the ground. The opponent falls backwards onto the stick and is explicitly 
impaled, with the stick protruding from their chest. Jade then explicitly tears 
her opponent's head off, with bloodspray noted, and explicitly plants it on the 
stick.<br>
- Quan Chi explicitly rips his opponent's leg off, accompanied by copious 
bloodspray. As they lie on the ground, he explicitly beats them with the severed 
leg for a prolonged period of time.<br>
-Kabal uses long hooks to explicitly pull out an opponent's intestines before 
explicitly impaling the opponent on two spikes.<br>
- Baraka explicitly lodges a blade (attached to his wrists) in an opponent's 
stomach and hoists them above his head. He spins them round and explicitly 
decapitates and dismembers them, accompanied by copious bloodspray.</font><font color="#808080">&lt;- 
Highlight.</font><br>
<br>
Oh yeah... and Version 3 is Koming...<hr color="#333333">
02/21/11 - Let me know what you think about this condensed version of the MK9 
Info so far...
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.angelfire.com/va3/mk/mk9/test3.htm">Klick 
Here</a> <hr color="#333333">
02/19/11 - I have some requests for the MK fans. Hopefully that's you... Check 
our official forum for more info. Look under MK2011 and MKArmageddon. Need your 
opinion on one, and skilled writers on the other.<hr color="#333333">
02/18/11 - MK2011 Section updated. Maybe jumping the gun a bit, we have moved 
Sheeva and surprisingly enough Kintaro, both to the &quot;Konfirmed&quot; section of 
MK2011. So far our... &quot;speculations&quot; have been correct... We've had Noob Saibot 
listed as Konfirmed for months while people argued over his inclusion in the 
game. And finally we got to see a tease of his moveset from IGN, confirming his 
inclusion.<br>
<br>
So now we're left with... An Unkonfirmed Rain and a possible Motaro inclusion. I 
know that Rain was meant as a joke kharacter in UMK3/MKT, and his appearance in 
MKArmageddon... Well let's face it, that was probably the highlight of 
Armageddon and it was sadly lacking...<br>
<br>
But I love the Kharacter. And I'm crossing my fingers for his inclusion in 
MK2011.<br>
<br>
As for Motaro... Whether he's in or whether he's out doesn't really affect how I 
view the game. Just please... (NetherRealm Studios, I'm talking to you here) If 
you're going to include Motaro... Do not... and I repeat Do Not... Forget his 
legs this time. I'm serious.<br>
<br>
Who ever heard of a 2 legged Centaur?<hr color="#333333">
02/17/11 - MK2011 Liu Kang and Noob Saibot Gameplay Vids Uploaded.<hr color="#333333">
02/16/11 - MK2011 Klassic Jade Render is now available, I apologize for the 
delay in the update, I am currently off-site for the moment. There was a reveal 
vid of Noob Saibot for MK2011 (Which we have had listed as confirmed for quite 
some time) that has been floating around which I have been unable to view 
unfortunately, yesterday MKKSG celebrated it's 9th birthday, and unfortunately 
due to circumstances beyond my control I was unable to celebrate it in the way 
that I wanted, however further along in the week maybe I can set up a retrospect 
page or something along those lines. We have come a long way and have covered 
every game in as much detail as possible, even though we technically started 
with Deadly Alliance in 2002... With the success of the MKvsDC guide for our 
site, I have no doubt in my mind that demand for our MK2011 guide will be even 
greater.<hr color="#333333">
02/10/11 - MKArmageddon Wii Sections have been updated with the 
Kreate-A-Kombatant's WiiMote Moves. Also, Liu Kang's History Vid is now 
available in the MK9 &quot;Trailers&quot; section. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
02/07/11 - MKArmageddon Wii Section has been further expanded with more info on 
the different controllers that can be used. Now we feature full WiiMote support 
for MKArmageddon... Still need to get Konfirmation on Kreate-A-Kombatant's 
movelist with WiiMote however... Liu Kang Shadow Wallpaper #2 Released and 
Uploaded! Enjoy! Also added info on Liu Kang's Fatalities.<hr color="#333333">
02/02/11 - MK4 and MKGold Sections now have streaming endings.<hr color="#333333">
02/01/11 - ALL of our printable MK Movelists have been updated and re-formatted. 
They are no longer in TXT format but in HTML format, and have been given BOLD 
and UNDERLINE formatting to make them easier to read, as well as an added Date 
Stamp (at the bottom of each movelist).<hr color="#333333">
01/29/11 - Klassic renders of Sub-Zero and Reptile have been re-uploaded and are 
of better quality, and Ermac joins them as well...<br>
<br>
Oh and did anybody notice the character in the background of Mileena's Gameplay 
vid?&nbsp; The majority of conversation I've noted concerning her is that she 
might be a new character, possibly being Scarlet (Skarlet, Ruby, Krimson, w/e 
that was rumored to exist in MKII and UMK3)&nbsp; My best guess is that she will 
be a &quot;Secret/Hidden Character&quot; for the new MK.<br>

mechanic. In addition, Mortal Kombat introduces a number of new game-play 
features including tag team and a deeper story mode. Players can choose from an 
extensive lineup of the game’s renowned warriors and challenge their friends in 
traditional 1 vs. 1 matches or take on several new game modes.

12/12/10 - MK9 PS3 section updated. <hr color="#333333">
12/07/10 - With the dissolution of the Midway Forums, and the current failure of 
the new MK boards, I have decided to open up a forum of my own.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://mkksg.createmybb3.com/index.php">CLICK HERE TO ACCESS OUR NEW 
FORUM!!</a><br>
The MK9 bios have been updated yet again...<br>
<br>
Roster updated! New Konfirmed Kharacters for MK (2011): Noob Saibot, Smoke, 
Kabal, Sindel, Stryker, and a surprise reveal of Quan Chi!... All other 
characters besides Quan Chi have been sitting in my &quot;Unkonfirmed&quot; section of MK9 
for quite some time, and were almost guaranteed to be included in this rendition 
of MK. Quan Chi on the other hand, who was supposed to be DLC for MKvsDC, was 
always in the back of my mind for MK9, however he wasn't what I would call 
&quot;guaranteed&quot; to make the cut. Well now he's official.<br>
<br>
The only characters left to be revealed for MK9 that I would consider 
&quot;guarantees&quot; are: Liu Kang, Baraka, Jade, Sheeva, Rain, and possibly Kintaro and 
Motaro.<br>
<br>
<i>Crossing fingers for Rain, and Sareena as a possible suprise roster addition! 
Honestly this roster is looking better and better.</i> <hr color="#333333">
11/12/10 - Sub-Zero Vignette Released! Check the Trailers section under MK 
(2011). <hr color="#333333">
11/11/10 - Sonya and Goro have been confirmed to be in the new MK, as well as 
Ermac, our site has had Ermac listed as confirmed for some time now.
<hr color="#333333">
11/01/10 - Jax and the Subway stage have been confirmed for Mortal Kombat 
(2011). I have yet to update the MK2011 pages yet to reflect this, as I have 
been rather busy this month with all the Halloween activities and whatnot. (I am 
currently off location using an iMac on dialup connection.) I am still excited 
about the game and looking forward to playing it and covering it for the site, 
my first instinct is going to be to play the game first before reviewing it, 
however after getting so much attention and praise for the MKvsDC move-list, my 
first priority will be getting the MK2011 move-list finalized and uploaded as 
quickly as possible when the game comes out. It's all about the fans.

the game: MK Kompilation. We are making good progress, more information coming 
soon.<hr color="#333333">
05/01/09 - Untitled MK Mugen Project page updated with second set of confirmed 
characters.<hr color="#333333">
04/22/09 - Untitled MK Mugen Project page updated with first set of confirmed

04/17/09 - Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero pages updated, mainly the 
walkthrough page.<hr color="#333333">
03/26/09 - Mortal Kombat Revelations Sega Genesis Hack main page and movelist 
page updated.<hr color="#333333">
02/20/09 - My guide on &quot;Mortal Kombat Revelations&quot;, the Sega Genesis Hack which 
is made by the same creators of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; is out now. 
Having played the game I have to say that it feels tighter than UMKT, however 
cutting back on some of the finishers for some characters and omitting some 
characters completely makes it feels more like a downgrade. I have to say that 
Hydro is awesome tho. Not really into Quan Chi all that much but he's ok I 
guess.<br>
<br>
YO!&nbsp; I need some help concerning making a custom MK game.&nbsp; I have a 
good idea of what I want made but I lack the resources or knowledge to do it 
myself.&nbsp; What I am looking for is a team of talented individuals who are 
willing to devote a good portion of their time in constructing what I'm looking 
at as a definitive version of the Komplete MK saga.&nbsp; For what I would like 
to be accomplished, I'm going to need experienced Mame editors.&nbsp; I have 
debated about using Mugen... But I'd like to stray from that if at all possible.&nbsp; 
It doesn't feel like a true MK game to me when using Mugen.&nbsp; I am already 
constructing my &quot;definitive&quot; version of a movelist and a roster.&nbsp; 57+ 
characters.&nbsp; More info will be given out later.&nbsp; I would like to keep 
the gameplay identical to arcade play, (no new krazy fatalities that just look 
awful, or adding dumb characters for no reason) however make some graphical 
changes such as updated/new stages as well as new intros and endings for most 
characters.&nbsp; To keep the game feeling like a good combination of klassic 
and new.&nbsp; I have a good mental image of what I want, I just need some 
individuals to bring it to life.&nbsp; If you are interested in donating your 
time, PLEASE <a href="mailto:trav.lane84@gmail.com">contact me</a>.<hr color="#333333">
02/08/09 - MK4/MKGold Move List/Bios and Movelists updated.<hr color="#333333">
02/02/09 - Printable Movelists for MKTrilogy updated. Finally. I might make 
small revisions to it soon tho, concerning Shang Tsung's morphs. I think I am 
coming down with a small bug, so I'll have to get back to updating the site at a 
later date. Hopefully it will be ready before news on MK9 starts coming out...<hr color="#333333">
01/29/09 - More updates on MK3, UMK3, MKA, UMK, and MKT main pages. I've also 
updated movelists for all sections minus the MKT section, it'll be coming soon.<hr color="#333333">
01/27/09 - Just a note, going through movelists now. Finding a few errors here 
and there, will be updating a few sections hopefully later today or tomorrow. If 
you notice any errors please help me out.<hr color="#333333">
01/26/09 - More updates to MK3, UMK3, MKA, UMK, MKT Move List/Bios pages. 
Updated Printable Movelists coming ASAP.<hr color="#333333">
01/24/09 - With the lack of MKvsDC updates, I've updated/Simplified/Reorganized 
MKII, MK3, and UMK3 Move List/Bios page as well as Printable Movelist. Koming 
soon, more reorganizing of some sections as well as a Downloadable Kharacter 
section for MKvsDC.<hr color="#333333">
<center><a name="2008"><font size="3"><b>2008</b></font></a></center>
<hr color="#333333">
12/12/08 - Updated/Simplified/Reorganized some MK Shaolin Monks pages.<hr color="#333333">
12/11/08 - Updated with a Hi-Res render and a custom wallpaper of Dark Kahn from 
MKvsDC.<hr color="#333333">
12/04/08 - Well since the user &quot;VA3&quot;'s IGN account was dead (inactive over long 
period of time), I talked to the IGN staff and had it removed as well as the 
Movelist. I have uploaded my newest movelist, so now the IGN one is correct. If 
I update the movelist on here, I will update it on IGN as well.<hr color="#333333">
12/03/08 - Updated MKvsDC Move list pages with minor corrections.<hr color="#333333">
12/02/08 (Update) - I have noticed that older versions of my MKvsDC printable 
movelists are on IGN. Uploaded by a user named &quot;VA3&quot;... It's not me... I 
appreciate the fact that they left a link to my site, but now every user who 
gets my movelist from IGN will have the outdated version. I'm not upset that my 
movelist was uploaded elsewhere, I just want the best possible version to be 
available. So yeah just giving everyone a head's up. I would rather prefer 
someone to give out the links to those pages rather than copying the pages 
themselves. I have another update coming soon on those movelists btw. A few 
corrections on locations and adding one of Captain Marvel's Pro Moves that I 
missed. When oh when will the definitive version be completed? So again, I 
encourage the sharing of the site to others however please share the link and 
not the movelist itself. ;)<hr color="#333333">
12/02/08 - Updated MKvsDC Movelist pages with updated supermoves and minor 
corrections.<hr color="#333333">
11/23/08 - Updated MKvsDC Endings page as well as All Movelist pages. All 
Fatalities and Brutalities are correct and contain distances. Still need to list 
Dark Kahn's moves... If you noticed any errors please notify me. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
11/19/08 - Updating Movelists again. All special moves are correct I believe. 
Still working on testing finishers. Updated Endings page. All MK character's 
endings are up! Time to work on the DC side next... Need to list Dark Kahn's 
moves... If you noticed any errors please notify me. Also keep in mind that 
since I'm having to convert moves to and from the xbox 360 pages and their 
printable counterparts, the possibility for error is great. I'm constantly 
updating em as I find em.<hr color="#333333">
11/17/08 - Just got done playing MKvsDC. I started on the DC story mode first to 
save the MK side (the best) for last. I have to say that so far the game has 
impressed me. For those of you who don't know, I'm also a Superman and DC fan 
from back in the day. And I enjoyed his involvement as well as a few other 
character's involvement from the DC side. My initial fears of the game were 
totally unfounded and I have to say that this game is a FAR IMPROVEMENT over 
previous MK games. That being said... I thought that the ending for the DC side 
was kinda like a &quot;WTF&quot; moment, but I'm glad that they didn't do anything 
predictable. Honestly I didn't see THAT coming, lol. All the DC Kharacters 
played fairly well. I don't really have a favorite out of the bunch, I enjoy 
each of their strengths and honestly couldn't choose a favorite since I like em 
so much... My hands hurt so bad trying to type this, lol. I uploaded some pics 
you might be interested in. And I'm working on going through the movelist again. 
I think I saw an error with Sub-Zero's movelist. If anybody notices any errors 
PLEASE let me know. I'd appreciate it. For those playing the game, enjoy. For 
those thinking about buying the game please do. I've thoroughly enjoyed it so 
far. And with that I'm out.<br>

11/14/08 - MKvsDC sections now has KOMPLETE BIOS, MOVELISTS, and FATALITIES 
including Shao Kahn &amp; Darkseid. (Still waiting for more info on Dark Kahn) 
ENJOY!!!! PS3 Section updated!<hr color="#333333">
11/13/08 - Slowly updating MKvsDC section with the KOMPLETE movelist as the 
information is being leaked over the intrawebs (lol.). So if you don't want to 
be spoiled, don't look at it. K? ;) For those that don't want to be spoiled, I 
hope you actually read this instead of skipping straight to that section... I 
figure if you didn't want to see it you wouldn't look in the first place... ;)<hr color="#333333">
11/03/08 - Updated with a Hi-Res render of Shao Kahn and Darkseid from MKvsDC... 
Wallpapers too!<hr color="#333333">
10/31/08 - Updated MKvsDC's Movelist page with Sonya, Catwoman, and Sub-Zero's 
Fatalites! Sonya's Handstand Neckbreaker Fatality will remind Veteran MK4 
players of a Tanya or Sonya specific move, Catwoman's Whip Neckbreaker Fatality 
is very animalistic in nature and fits her well. Sub-Zero's Lifting Ice Shatter 
Fatality is very reminiscent of his MK3 Ice Shatter move. All 3 Fatalities 
looked good. There is a noticeable lack of blood in all 3 Fatalities, however 
it's easily overlooked considering.<hr color="#333333">
10/16/08 - Updated MKvsDC's Movelist page with the Joker's 2nd Fatality! 
Reminiscent of Noob Saibot's Throwing Stars fatality from MK Deception, The 
Joker throws multiple cards into his victim's torso before putting the final 
card in the victim's head!<hr color="#333333">
10/12/08 - Updated MK Armageddon's Arena page.<hr color="#333333">
10/11/08 - Updated with Hi-Res renders of some MKvsDC Arenas! I've added the 
Fortress of Solitude, Hangar, Lexcorp, Gotham City Street, and Raiden's temple.<hr color="#333333">
10/09/08 - Updated with a Hi-Res render of Baraka and Lex Luthor from MKvsDC, as 
well as a custom Wallpaper of Baraka and Lex Luthor from MKvsDC.<hr color="#333333">
10/07/08 - Added a new MKvsDC Wallpaper.<hr color="#333333">
09/24/08 - Added some older MK Deception Wallpapers and Renders.<hr color="#333333">
09/24/08 - New Wallpaper of Scorpion's MKvsDC Fatality!<hr color="#333333">
09/12/08 - Updated with a Hi-Res render of Kano from MKvsDC, as well as a custom 
Wallpaper of Kano from MKvsDC.<br>
I have also found out that Shao Kahn and Darkseid <u>MAY</u> be unlockable, and 
if they are then it would make sense that they are both bosses.<br>
Update: Also added a new MKvsDC Wallpaper to the wallpaper sections. Enjoy!<hr color="#333333">
09/11/08 - Updated with a Hi-Res render of Deathstroke the Terminator aka Slade, 
as well as a custom Wallpaper of Deathstroke.<br>
Also, amazingly the last 4 MKvsDC Kharacters have been announced and are as 
follows:<br>
Baraka, Shao Kahn, Lex Luthor, and Darkseid.<br>
Making the total (as of now) roster at 22.<br>
Also the last MK Podkast made hints of the sub-boss as possibly being Goro... 
that's not confirmed tho, just a rumor.<br>
And since Shao Kahn and Darkseid are officially part of the normal roster, I'm 
going to assume that Shao Kahn might be the DC's Boss and Darkseid will be MK's 
boss... or... There is a yet to be announced Final Boss... We'll just have to 
wait and see. Enjoy the updates. And I'll be getting better pics of the new 
characters as soon as I can.<hr color="#333333">
09/05/08 - FINALLY updated with a Hi-Res render of the MKvsDC version of Raiden, 
as well as a custom Wallpaper of Raiden from MKvsDC.<br>
I have also been working on the UMKT page. It's a bit more organized now.<hr color="#333333">
08/30/08 - Updated Movelists for both Kitana and The Joker from MKvsDC. Still 
not the official version yet, so those moves may still change...<hr color="#333333">
08/29/08 - Dropped 800x600 support. Dropped Midi support. Simplified 
Index/Update Page Entrance. Updated Affiliate/Links Page. Raiden 
render/wallpaper coming soooon... More updates coming soon...<br>
Update: Raiden Render updated however I'm still waiting on the high resolution 
render that will hopefully be released later today...<br>
Update: Uploaded new Liu Kang confronting Scorpion wallpaper... Nice, lol.<hr color="#333333">
08/22/08 - MKvsDC Bios, Roster, and wallpaper sections updated with the new 22 
Kharacter roster size... Personally I hope they add 2 more to make it an even 12 
on each side, but I'm happy with 22 total.<hr color="#333333">
08/20/08 - Added 4 NEW Confirmed Kharacters to the MKvsDC section: Raiden, Kano, 
Wonder Woman, and Deathstroke. Updated movelist information for Liu Kang, 
Kitana, Captain Marvel, Joker, and Green Lantern. Also updated The Joker's 
Fatality.<br>
Gamespot has also revealed new information on the &quot;rage system&quot; of the game as 
follows:<br>
&quot;Each character will have a rage meter, just underneath their health meter. You 
build your rage meter by taking and dealing damage, or by blocking opponent 
strikes. As the meter fills up, you can use breaks to block opponent strikes. If 
you let the rage meter build up completely, however, you can enter rage mode (by 
pressing the shoulder buttons). Here, you'll have roughly six seconds to kick as 
much butt as you possibly can. Your attacks will be more powerful and, more 
importantly, unblockable so, as long as you can make contact, you'll be pounding 
your foe into dust. Just watch out, because his or her rage meter will be 
similarly building--as a result, you'll have to use your rage meter at the right 
moment (preferably to finish off your opponent). Fail to do so, and you might 
find yourself on the receiving end of a rage flurry.&quot;<br>
Added Wonder Woman render to the MKvsDC section... Also updated the wallpaper 
section of the site with MKvsDC Wonder Woman. Enjoy.<br>
Oh and for those of you who don't know, the roster has been officially updated 
to have not 10, but 11 characters to each side. I have yet to implement this new 
change into the Bio pages.<br>
So we have 2 characters on the MK and DC sides that have yet to be revealed as 
well as a &quot;BIG BOSS&quot; and the <i><u>possibility</u></i> of secret hidden 
characters...<hr color="#333333">
08/18/08 - Added Green Lantern render to the MKvsDC section... Also updated the 
wallpaper section of the site with MKvsDC Green Lantern. Also updated Arenas 
page with higher resolution pics. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
08/17/08 - Added Jax render to the MKvsDC section... Also updated the wallpaper 
section of the site with MKvsDC Jax. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
08/04/08 - Added Kitana render to the MKvsDC section... Also updated the 
wallpaper section of the site with MKvsDC Kitana. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
07/25/08 - New confirmed characters for MKvsDC: Kitana, Jax, The Joker, and 
Green Lantern (Hal Jordan). Also added Joker render to the MKvsDC section. Also 
updated the wallpaper section of the site with MKvsDC Joker. Expect new 
wallpapers and the remaining renders to be released soon.<hr color="#333333">
07/24/08 - Added Captain Marvel render to the MKvsDC section... Also updated the 
wallpaper section of the site with MKvsDC Captain Marvel. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
07/23/08 - Added Liu Kang render to the MKvsDC section... Also updated the 
wallpaper section of the site with MKvsDC Liu Kang. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
07/11/08 - Added Shang Tsung render to the MKvsDC section, as well as updated 
all character renders with their high resolution versions. Enjoy. Eventually 
I'll get to updating the stage renders as well.<br>
Update: Also added Shang Tsung wallpaper, and I will be updating the character 
roster as well with 2 new confirmed characters: Liu Kang and Captain Marvel.<hr color="#333333">
07/08/08 - Added renders for both The Flash and Sonya Blade... Also updated the 
wallpaper section of the site with perhaps the breas... I mean... best wallpaper 
I have ever seen... I mean I have it on my computer now and I can't help but 
stare... In fact I'm logging off now to look at it some more... Seriously tho 
this makes up for the Shaolin Monks Sonya render ten times over guys. Nice job!<hr color="#333333">
07/05/08 - New confirmed character for MKvsDC: Shang Tsung.<hr color="#333333">
06/30/08 - MKvsDC Catwoman render uploaded, (Low Res). Also did some work to the 
MK Advance section making it more readable.<hr color="#333333">
06/27/08 - New confirmed character for MKvsDC: Catwoman.<hr color="#333333">
06/19/08 - New confirmed characters for MKvsDC: Sonya, and The Flash.<hr color="#333333">
06/11/08 - Updated the MK vs DC section. Added Renders for characters and 
stages. You can find higher quality artwork at the official MK vs DC website. 
(There is a link in each of our sections.)<hr color="#333333">
05/30/08 - Did some more work to the UMK3 section. There are now separate 
printable movelists for the SNES/Genesis and Arcade/Saturn versions of the game. 
Also updated the Codes section with more information.<hr color="#333333">
05/04/08 - Spent the last couple of days updating a few sections, adding few 
minor tweaks to the site here and there, added the &quot;Mortal Kombat Advance&quot; 
section which was fairly easy to complete, however I'm not expecting a lot of 
interest in that section considering the game... Will update the site with more 
hand held systems as I get a chance. My next likely update will be on the UMK3 
sections. Stay tuned.<hr color="#333333">
04/26/08 - MK Unchained section Kompleted and Updated. Fixed the new Menu Based 
Navigation.<hr color="#333333">
04/24/08 - Working on Kleaning-Up the &quot;Mortal Kombat Unchained&quot; section. It's 
not uploaded yet, I'm about 50% completed with the main bios and moves page (I'm 
putting it all together similar to UMK and UMKT's pages.) and IMO it looks 
really nice and functions quite well. Expect to see it in about a day or so. 
Might update a few other sections the same way... Oh and if I ever get around to 
it, I'm going to fix the menu driven navigation so that it's not so sensitive. 
Drives me crazy, lol. Wish there was more to report. More koming soon tho.<hr color="#333333">

You know what pisses me off? The fact that the gameplay &amp; graphics actually 
looks like it would make a decent MK game, but there's friggin' Batman in it. 
What a waste.<hr color="#333333">
04/18/08 - News on &quot;MK8&quot; has surfaced. I don't really know how to say it. I have 
never felt so negatively towards a MK game's release so early to it's initial 
announcement.<br>
Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe.<br>
I kid you not, I wish I was. Go check out mortalkombatonline. I really don't 
feel like even posting a picture. I'm beyond disgusted. I have lost my faith in 
Midway and possibly Humanity. That's really all I have to say at the moment. 
Here's a poll. Want to see how many ppl agrees and disagrees with me. I'll 
update again later on in the day, hopefully.<!-- v- PollGEAR Code by http://htmlgear.com -v --><script language="JavaScript" src="http://htmlgear.tripod.com/poll/control.poll?u=trav_001&i=4&a=render">

04/14/08 - Second Update on Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy section. Most of the 
information is available, have a few sections that need to be kompleted, I'll 
get to it soon!<hr color="#333333">
04/14/08 - Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy Section uploaded, still needs a lot of 
work however I felt like it was where I could post it. Check out the game if you 
haven't already, I think Chameleon and Khameleon have like 20 moves each, lol. 
I'm still blown away by the amount of content. Amazing.<hr color="#333333">
04/11/08 - Did some updates to the site - organized the system of the Main Menu 
and organized the Klassic Menu a bit better... Oh you did know that you could 
access the original Main Menu page by clicking on our site's logo on the 
navigation page right? For those that preferred it that way. (Myself included.) 
Oh and now you can find under &quot;Unofficial&quot; a link to a new section on the 
fan-created Sega Genesis Rom Hack: Ultimate Mortal Kombat Trilogy. There is a 
link to the creator's site if you want to download it, I recommend it. There is 
a movelist on his site, but I wanted to clean it up a bit and make it more &quot;user 
friendly&quot;. I mean the roster's so huge, it's hard to use a notepad file to find 
all you need, so I'm giving it a navigational touch. This game has 57+ Klassic 
2D MK Kharacters! And each Kharacter has like 3-4 Fatalities, plus an Animality, 
Pit, Babality, Friendship, and Brutality! I mean this must've took forever to 
do, I mean just the amount of time it's taking me to go through their movelist 
alone is insane. You gotta see this if you haven't already, and for those that 
have, check up on the site in a few days, I'll be trying to get the section 
kompleted.<br>
Other than that, I added a new page to the MK4 section on weapons and outfits...<br>
Other than those updates, that's about it. Looking forward to what
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.noob.com/">Noob.Com</a>'s updated will be in 
the following days... Hope it's news on MK8... Welp I'm out! Later!<hr color="#333333">
03/09/08 - MK8 Teaser... Fake?... Official?<br>
<br>
(Video was Removed From Youtube)<br>
<br>
04/11/08 - Update: Most of the ppl I have spoken with about the video have 
agreed that it is indeed &quot;Fan Made&quot; however I still have to give the creator 
props for the smoke effects, that part did look professional.<hr color="#333333">
01/09/08 - Did some fixes to the Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 section.<hr color="#333333">
01/08/08 - Added &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat&quot; for Nintendo DS section for our DS 
fans. As always, if you notice any errors feel free to report them to me. That 
goes with all the sections of the site. Peace out.<hr color="#333333">
01/03/08 - Cleaned up and updated Human Smoke and Classic Sub-Zero's MK Trilogy 
pages.<hr color="#333333">
<center><a name="2007"><font size="3"><b>2007</b></font></a></center>
<hr color="#333333">
10-12-07 - Just Kleaning up some sections.&nbsp; Check out my new bio shots of 
Smoke, Jade, and Noob for MKII.<br>
(I wuz bored).&nbsp; Removed a few unnecessary sections.&nbsp; The Fan Film has 
been officially abandoned.&nbsp; As always I appreciate and welcome your 
opinions and will continue to update and improve upon the site as much as I 
possibly can.<br>
<br>
Oh and can anyone remember when the site officially opened?&nbsp; The earliest 
file I've found so far was from 11-16-02.<hr color="#333333">
08/27/07 - For those of you that have been emailing me about completing the 
Krypt section for Mortal Kombat Armageddon... STOP IT!! IT WILL BE DONE WHEN 
IT'S DONE!!! Jeez... lol. I'm just messin' wit ya, it's already completed and 
uploaded so whatcha doing here for? Go check it out! NOW!! lol.<hr color="#333333">
08/27/07 - Ashrah's official bio for MK Armageddon has been released and 
updated. Check it out.<hr color="#333333">
08/03/07 - A viewer of the website named Rachel has made a kustom MKA wallpaper 
and has given me permission to host it here, you can find it in the wallpapers 
section. I'm definitely impressed with it and I hope you all enjoy it. Rachel is 
also helping me with minor critiques on the site and has given me a few ideas on 
some graphical elements of some sections, and I thank her for doing so, I 
definitely appreciate the positive comments, they have really motivated me. I 
also appreciate the continued interest in the site with the many hits it has 
been continuing to get. Now if I could only fix my low web space problem...<hr color="#333333">
07/26/07 - Since everybody's hungry for new bios, I have took it upon myself to 
&quot;fill in&quot; the blank bios with custom made bios, coming directly from the 
Armageddon game. So there are currently no &quot;blank&quot; bios at the moment, some 
contain more information than others and I apologize for that, some ppl's 
storyline weren't elaborated on that much in the game. These are basically 
&quot;fillers&quot; until their real bios come out. The official bios have &quot;quotation 
marks&quot; around them, are in 1st person, and are generally longer. The ones that I 
have written or the ones that came from their bio kards are in 3rd person and do 
not have these quotations. I hope you enjoy. L8tr.<hr color="#333333">
07/06/07 - I've uploaded the movelist for UMK3. I'll be working on the Kodes 
Section soon. I swear I was putting this game off for awhile, because with all 
the different versions of UMK3, it felt like I was working on 4 games at once. 
And now they have the XBOX Live version and they're working on &quot;Ultimate Mortal 
Kombat&quot; for Nintendo DS. Geez, lol.<hr color="#333333">
06/28/07 - Khameleon's MKA Special Moves have been updated, finally. Also found 
out her weapon style - &quot;Falchion&quot;. It's basically a carbon copy of Ashrah's 
Kriss in terms of gameplay. I haven't seen it in action yet, but I've heard that 
it's similar to a big Machete. Maybe a picture would help? I'll be updating my 
kustom Khameleon KAK soon, oh and I'm almost complete with the UMK3 section... 
(For those of you who gave up on expecting me to get it finished) It's up but 
not 100% finished yet. I hope to have it finished by today. No promises tho. 
Thanks for stopping by!<hr color="#333333">

I'm including a preview pic b/c I'm excited about it. It's nowhere near 
completed yet and might not be finished for a few weeks, but when I'm done it 
should basically cover all information related to KAK mode for MK Armageddon. 
Including prices. Wish me luck. If anybody wants to help, all I need are text 
lists. I can do the coding from there. Oh and have you checked out the Khameleon 
KAK vid? Go check it out if you haven't yet. You can find it from Khameleon's 
MKA page.<hr color="#333333">
05/15/07 - Added a KAK Recipe for creating the WII version of Khameleon for XBOX

10/16/06 - Everyone who was having trouble discovering the hidden Relics in MK 
Armageddon's Konquest mode will discover something new and useful added to our 
MK Armageddon section today. That's right - The Komplete Relic guide for 
Armageddon. Don't thank me tho, thank
<a href="http://users.ign.com/about/zeke009">Zeke</a>, a member of IGN's 
community. This is mostly his baby (check his credits), and I while I did not 
take part in it's inception, I did use it to unlock all 60 Relic Items. This is 
must-have info for everyone, especially considering even Prima's Konquest 
Section in their MKA strategy guide was incorrect in a few places. Nice job and 
thanks again to Zeke and everyone else who helped bring this info to light!<hr color="#333333">
10/15/06 - Armageddon Movesets are completed. XBOX and PS2 Movelist pages up. 
Updated info and help with Konquest mode coming ASAP.<hr color="#333333">
09/10/06 - I'm still here. I've been doing work to the site to certain areas. 
Mainly focusing on the Armageddon and Unchained sections. I've also been working 
on the Deception section as well. Expect a re-made Krypt section in the near 
future.<br>
On a sad note, MK Armageddon <u>may</u> be the last MK game that this site will 
cover. I wish I could go into detail, but I'd rather not. I haven't made up my 
mind yet on the matter. We'll see sometime after Armageddon is released...<hr color="#333333">
08/12/06 - Updates on MKA section: Liu Kang Bio Released!<hr color="#333333">
07/27/06 - MKSM update - Added Johnny Cage Fatality that I missed (Whoops...),

05/12/06 - With Info pouring in from E3 concerning MK Armageddon, I've been hard 
at work updating bio pages as soon as I gather info. I have updated info on 
about 1/4 of the roster I think (I am currently pretty tired and have 
momentarily lost the ability to do fractions in my head without it hurting...) 
But here you go MK fans, I have updated info on the following: Ashrah, Taven, 
Shao Kahn, Jarek, Kai, Noob-Smoke, Meat (Yeah, I said Meat!), Goro, Kitana, 
Reiko, Scorpion, Rain, Sub-Zero, Stryker, Sheeva, Sareena, Shinnok, Fujin, and 
Sektor. Most info is either Correct Special Moves, Correct Fighting/Weapon 
Styles used, an updated pic for Blaze...<br>
I've also gathered the Kustom Fatality movelist, new stage info, and more. I'll 
be updating that as soon as I can... This game is looking to be progressing 
pretty well. And oh yeah, the Character Selection Screen is accurate for the E3 
Build.<br>
Origin and Last Appearance bio pages are currently outdated. I'll update them as 
soon as I get time. Later!<hr color="#333333">

Klick here to see GameSpot's MK Armageddon E3 2006 Preview + New Images!!!</a><br>
(POSSIBLE SPOILER INFORMATION REGARDING THE KONQUEST CHARACTER, HIGHLIGHT TO 
REVEAL:) <font color="#000000">&quot;Bob&quot; or &quot;Hero&quot; character's true name is revealed 
- &quot;Taven&quot;. It has been revealed that Taven is from Edenia, and has been told (by 
his father) to go against his brother Daegon (Who may or may not be another 
hidden character) to capture an ancient weapon which supposedly has the power to 
destroy &quot;Blaze&quot;, and ultimately prove to be his father's successor...</font> 
Also, one of Shinnok's special moves has been revealed - a &quot;Skull-Fist 
Fireball&quot;. Fans of MK4 will remember Shinnok not having any special moves to 
speak of, but he had the ability to mimic other character's moves... I'm glad 
they decided to give him more dimension as a character seeing as how he's 
supposed to be a former ruler of The Netherrealm...<hr color="#333333">
04/14/06 - Updated MK3 Codes section and Smoke bio. If you notice anything that 
needs correcting, let me know. Peace out.<hr color="#333333">
04/12/06 - Updated MK3 and Trilogy Endings pages. Check em out. Graphics heavy. 
If images do not load, right click on the pics and select &quot;show image&quot;. I've 
tested them all out, they're there.<hr color="#333333">
04/04/06 - More KAF ideas for Armageddon, and I added a new code for the SNES 
version of MK1. (Play as Reptile!) - Requires Game Genie.<hr color="#333333">
03/09/06 - Incase you didn't notice, I've been going back and making everything 
look better in other sections. Currently I'm practically finished with the MK1, 
MK2, MK4, and MK Gold sections. After noticing that my MK4 section had a few 
errors on it, I decided to go back and clean it up, and after I fixed that 
section, I figured why not go back and clean up the other sections? What can you 
expect from these updates? Well the Printable Move Lists have been written a tad 
better, most bio sections have been cleaned up, I even went and tested every 
move for the MK4 section so you shouldn't have a problem there. The biggest 
update being in the MK1 section. Each bio contains a lot more info than 
before... But seriously if anybody notices any errors or anything... PLEASE LET 
ME KNOW!!!<hr color="#333333">
03/04/06 - Updated MK Armageddon Wallpaper, 2 new roster pages for MK 
Armageddon, one sorts characters by Origin, the other by Last Appearance. Check 
em out!<hr color="#333333">

02/22/06 - A new ad for Mortal Kombat: Unchained. Thanks goes out to Syclone 
from the <a href="http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/">Mortal Kombat Online</a>. 
It was revealed that the game would have six new fighters and feature a new 
endurance mode!<hr color="#333333">
02/06/06 - The official MK Armageddon website has been updated, although the 
only thing currently up is the dragon logo used to promote MK3. Check back often 
tho. You can find the site at: <a href="http://www.mkarmageddon.com">
http://www.mkarmageddon.com</a><hr color="#333333">
02/06/06 - I've moved a few things around on the site, making room for when the 
Armageddon section starts getting big. Since I started putting Armageddon, 
Deception, and Deadly Alliance wallpapers in the Shaolin Monks Wallpaper 
section, I just decided to make a general site wallpaper section, so now you can 
find those at the top of the left frame... Also cleaned up the Shaolin Monks 
section a bit, got rid of a few renders that could be found elsewhere, (I kept 
Smoke and Noob renders) Overall I was able to clear up about 1MB of space. Not 
much, but when you consider I'm only allowed 20MB total, it becomes necessary. 
Free sites have their disadvantages. I might upgrade one day, but not anytime 
soon. Keep checking back. Oh yeah, MK Armageddon's release date is currently 
October 2nd 2006!! They're taking reservations now at Gamestop and most Software 
Etc's.<hr color="#333333">
01/21/06 - MK Armageddon section updated! New pics in Bios, Kreate-A-Fighter,

11/16/05 - Mortal Kombat Deception section updated - Since news on MK Armageddon 
has been short, I decided to update the Deception section. FINALLY getting the 
Konquest section up. I can't believe I hadn't finished that yet. I only put up 
the main quest missions, not the side-quests, and I also left out the Mortal 
Kombat Tournament missions. I'll go back and put those in there eventually, when 
I have more time to spare.<hr color="#333333">
10/25/05 - Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks section updated - In the wallpaper 
section, you'll now find MKSM Ermac (MKD Ermac w/ MKSM Background), MKDA Frost 
(w/ MKD Background), and MKD Noob Smoke (w/ a basic dark background). Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">

section for MKSM has been updated once again. A walkthrough has been uploaded, 
however it is incomplete and currently only contains a walkthrough for Goro's 
Lair. I'll get the rest finished as soon as I can. I've also added a Wallpaper 
page, rather than just having the zip file.<hr color="#333333">
09/25/05 - Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero section updated - The Walkthrough 
is now up. Complete with a map of the Water Level.<hr color="#333333">

Fatalities and Moves for most characters. I did not have time to finish it

Sub-Zero. Coming soon: Johnny Cage Render. These are not wallpapers that you

for obvious reasons.<hr color="#333333">
09/22/05 - Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks section updated - Official Kitana Render 
has been released and is now available to you here. Coming soon: MKSM and MKMS

09/21/05 - New Section Uploaded - &quot;Fake Pics&quot;. Enjoy. If you like em, I'll make 
more eventually.<hr color="#333333">
09/21/05 - Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero section uploaded - With the 
release of Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, I figured that it was about time I got 
the MKMS section up and running. It's far from finished, but I've gotten most of 
its sections up. We're getting up to date around here, but it's coming slow. 
Especially with work and Shaolin Monks. Expect the MKSM section to be updated as 
soon as I get more info, as well as updates on the MKMS section, and I'm working 
on getting the MKTE, MKSF, UMK3 and a MK7 section up as well. Enjoy!<hr color="#333333">
09/20/05 - Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks section updated - I've added 2 new 
sections for MKSM. Smoke Missions, which contains info on how to find Smoke and 
how to do those damn missions of his, (what you unlock doing them is so worth 
it) and also I've included a section called &quot;Unlockables&quot; which contains info on 
how to unlock every character for MKSM, eventually it will also contain info on 
the other unlockable items, but I felt that the players needed this info first. 
I'll take care of the rest later.<hr color="#333333">
09/16/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: Both Sonya and Johnny Cage for MK1 are now 
available for download. More coming soon. I wish I could get more finished in 
less time, but I get burnt out pretty easily on skins. Oh well, enjoy these! 
More coming soon.<hr color="#333333">
09/15/05 -&nbsp; Most everybody knows about the Mortal Kombat Deception name 
change in France because of the translation issues. For some reason &quot;Deception&quot; 
translated in the French dialect apparently means &quot;Disappointment&quot;, so they 
decided to use the word &quot;Mystification&quot; instead... which apparently means 
&quot;Deception&quot;... I think... Makes sense to me... Anyway, in any topic where &quot;MK 
Mystification&quot; was brought up, they would always show a pic or logo from the 
original versions of Deception. I <i>assumed</i> that they would just use the 
original box covers and just refer to it as &quot;Mystification&quot; (Doesn't make much 
sense to us, I know, but this is Midway here). But today I was surfing the net 
and came upon a picture of the actual box they used for the XBOX version of the 
game. This is the first time I have seen this logo used ANYWHERE, so I decided 
to post it. This update is mainly for the people who have not seen this yet, and 
for the people who have seen it... well here it is again, and for the people 
living in the &quot;French areas&quot; who already have this cover... well here's your box 
cover. See? Everybody's happy. What? You were expecting an update of greater 
proportions? Yeah, so was I. See? Everybody's disappointed. DAMN YOU MIDWAY!!!! 
DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!<br>
(I'm just playin' Midway, you know I love you)<br>

09/11/05 - Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks section updated - One of Shang Tsung's 
Masked Guards pic/render uploaded. It is my guess that Johnny Cage, Baraka, or 
Kitana will probably be the next render officially revealed. And with the days 
'til it's release getting smaller, it makes one wonder how they're going to get 
most of the renders revealed in time. <u><b>Renders Revealed:</b></u><br>
Liu Kang<br>
Kung Lao<br>
Sonya Blade<br>
Sub-Zero (the eldest)<br>
Shang Tsung<br>
Reptile<br>
Kano<br>
Scorpion<br>
Masked Guard<br>
Raiden<br>
Baraka (unofficially)<br>
Kitana (unofficially)<br>
<u><b>Renders to be Revealed:</b></u><br>
Johnny Cage<br>
Goro<br>
Mileena<br>
Jade<br>
Smoke<br>
Sub-Zero's scarred younger brother (doubtful but a possibility)<br>
Noob Saibot<br>
Kabal (if he's in there)<br>
Ermac<br>
Shao Kahn<br>
Kintaro<br>
and possibly more renders of baddies that you'll have to face in MK:SM...
<hr color="#333333">
09/02/05 - Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks section updated - Movelist for both Liu 
Kang and Kung Lao for both XBOX and PS2 systems have been released. More coming 
soon. These are more than likely incomplete, but it will give me a place to 
start. Stay tuned for more info.<hr color="#333333">
09/01/05 - Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks section uploaded. Currently just pics of 
characters involved in the game (if I've missed any, let me know, and keep me 
informed of updates if you find them), however more info will be revealed later 
on... as it becomes available. Don't forget to click on the characters to get a 
higher resolution shot of that character. These are not the highest resolution 
that I have, but their size looks good in my browser on 1024X768 mode. Moves and 
Level info coming as soon as I get the info organized. Let me know what you 
think. Sign my guestbook or e-mail me if you wish. <hr color="#333333">
08/20/05 - Fan Film section updated. The official name of the Fan Film is 
released finally. All polls have been closed and results are now in a &quot;polls&quot; 
section. Future polls coming soon.<br>
<br>
<i>(pic deleted due to routine cleaning)</i><hr color="#333333">
08/13/05 - I updated the pics for the MKDA section, as well as cleaned up the 
lay-out of the bio section. I also updated the MKDA and MKD ending sections. 
There are now 2 for each game. 1 (High) has pictures, and the other (Low) does 
not, and is recommended for visitors with slower internet connections. We here 
at MKKSG are still lookin' after the little guys.<hr color="#333333">
08/07/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: I wasn't satisfied with either UMK3 Reptile nor 
UMK3 Smoke, so I redid them. I think they're acceptable now. I have trouble with 
shades of green and grey because I'm slightly color-blind.<hr color="#333333">
07/31/05 - MK Sims Skins Update:<br>
MK1 - Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Reptile (re-designs/repaints)<br>
UMK3 - Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Reptile, Smoke, Noob Saibot, Ermac, and Rain (slight 
re-designs/repaints)<br>
MKMS - Sareena, Kia, and Jataaka (minor repaints)<br>
MKTM - Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Reptile (slight re-designs/adjustments)<br>
MKA - Scorpion, Ermac, Rain, and Reptile (better looking eyes)<br>
<br>
New:<br>
MKT Khameleon (basically a repaint of the UMK3 females, but there you go...)<hr color="#333333">
07/24/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: UMK3 Kitana, Mileena, and Jade skins have been 
updated. Koming soon: MK6 Kira and others.<hr color="#333333">
07/23/05 - NEW POLL!! Help me decide what to name the upcoming fan-film. If you 
have a better idea than the two I am considering, please e-mail me. You can find 
my e-mail under the Contacts/Staff section.<hr color="#333333">
07/22/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: MK2 Kitana, Mileena, and Jade skins have been 
updated. Koming soon: updates to UMK3 Kitana, Mileena, and Jade. MK6 Kira is 
probably going to show up sometime in the future, and many of the skins will be 
getting updated. Still waiting on several meshes to be completed. Anybody with 
experience on Sim Meshing please contact me, I need some help. L8tr.<hr color="#333333">
07/22/05 - Hey check out what one of my buds made for me, it's Sub-Zero from MK 
Deception made entirely out of cardboard, ink, and about 3 or 4 weeks of sweat 
mixed in for good measure. I have it up on my wall and decided to show it off. 
If you can't tell from the pics, he used dotting techniques (I'll put a close up 
of it to show what I mean) and I think it look super great. My digital camera 
cut some of the bottom off, I'll try to get a better pic of it on here sometime. 
Thanks again Lawson.<br>
<hr color="#333333">
07/20/05 -&nbsp; Frost is complete! You can right click her pic here and 
download her, or you can find her alongside the other skins. Enjoy... But not 
too much, lol.<hr color="#333333">
07/04/05 - I've been updating the site here and there over the last week or so. 
Most of the pics for the sections are about as good as they're going to get for 
awhile. Stay tuned for upcoming sections, they will be available in the future. 
Also, I'm planning to include all the different versions of each game into this 
site in some fashion, there's just so many it's difficult, but we'll get it 
done. Keep enjoying the site. Gives us something to do.<hr color="#333333">
06/22/05 - Added a new poll to the &quot;MK Fan Film&quot; section. Currently in talks 
with someone who is capable of making all the outfits that I will need for the 
fan-film and working on a new Sims skin - MKDA Frost. She's going to be awhile 
tho, I have no free time anymore so I'm forced to work on the site at work, and 
in my spare time... I apologize for the delays in getting some stuff up and in 
the lack of updates. Hopefully I'll have some free time to myself soon.<hr color="#333333">
06/17/05 - MK Trilogy Section is up. (Finally!) I still need time to get the 
Kodes and Movelist sections up and running, but I'm going to be extremely busy 
for the next 4 days so if they're not finished today, I will get to them as soon 
as possible. Enjoy. I rushed to get these sections up, so if you notice any 
errors please <a href="mailto:trav.lane84@gmail.com">email me</a> and I'll get 
to it.<hr color="#333333">
05/04/05 - For anybody who's interested in the MK fan-film we're working on, or 
for any fan films for that matter, check out
<a href="http://www.forzateam.prv.pl/">this site</a>. It's not something that I 
would call &quot;amazing&quot; or even &quot;outstanding&quot; for that matter, but it is 
interesting and worth a look. I am in no means making fun of these movie makers, 
I'm simply saying watch the videos for yourself and make your own opinions. 
Their ninja outfits are decent, however their Shao Kahn needs work, and the 
ninja masks are downright awful. (BTW - This is definitely not what ours is 
going to look like, although it must've been fun making it.)<hr color="#333333">
05/04/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: All previous stated updates and additions are 
completed and have been uploaded. Enjoy!<hr color="#333333">
05/02/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: All MK2 Female Ninjas, MKA Ninjas, MK4 Noob, 
and MK6 Noob (both skins) have been updated and are looking great. I'm in the 
process of fixing a couple other skins as well (MK4 Jax, MK4 Reptile, MK4 Quan 
Chi, MK3 Cyber-Ninjas, and MKT Cage). Might also finally get a decent MK4 
Scorpion on here as well, even tho everybody and their uncle has made one... 
plus a MK1 Kano... Oh and I also have more TMNT skins on the way as well! L8tr.<hr color="#333333">
05/01/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: MK2 Baraka is finished and available for 
download!<hr color="#333333">
04/08/05 - Sorry for the lack of updates. If I'm not dealing with work, I'm 
wrapped up in either Knights II or DooM 3 for XBOX. I've taken a break from MK 
Sims for the moment. I guess where I did so many of them in such a short time 
that I burnt myself out, BUT FEAR NOT!!! I'm getting the itch to make Baraka 
from MK2. Everybody's been asking me about him and I've been waiting for a time 
to make him, and the time is growing close for Baraka to hit the Sims full 
force. The other incomplete sections of the site need to be finished as well, 
and I now have help on it, so that's good, but I could always use more help. I 
desperately need a Sims Skinner. But that's enough talk for now, at least you 
all know that I'm still not dead or anything and that I'm trying to get some 
work done for the site. Oh and yeah - the MIDI section has been updated with 
more MIDI's but it's currently down for the moment. I'll try to get it back up 
and running. Damn scripts. And for those of you who are still reading this, I 
appreciate your patience. I just wish I had something more entertaining to say. 
But there you go. What more do you expect from a free and totally non-funded 
site? I'd pass out free MK cookies if I could, but sadly dough is expensive... 
and for those of you who are asking yourself &quot;what the hell is this guy talking 
about?&quot;, all I can say is, &quot;yep.&quot; Then I smile and nod. - Trav<hr color="#333333">
03/12/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: MK2 Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Reptile, and Smoke have 
been updated! Enjoy! I was really excited about how they came out.<hr color="#333333">
03/10/05 - Along with the few Sims Skins that I'm going to be including as soon 
as I get their head meshes finished, I'm also adding more re-textured MK2 ninja 
skins. This time I believe they will be nearly identical to their in-game 
counterparts. Each update gets better and better. My only problem was finding 
the right texture for the skins, and having found the correct one, I shall make 
the best possible translation of the MK II ninjas. Making skins is tough! I'm 
also working on several others...<hr color="#333333">
03/06/05 - Just in case anyone was wondering, I don't like pop-ups or ads as 
much as the next person, but to keep this site free I have to maintain some sort 
of &quot;advertisement&quot; program going on here, mostly from Angelfire... but incase 
anyone was wondering, the advertisement and link for &quot;Cats Computing&quot; is 
ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE! I've bought plenty of hardware from them in the past. They 
support my site, I support their business. Check out their site, they're really 
great people over there... oh and did I mention I work for them? ;)<hr color="#333333">
03/06/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: MKSF Tremor Skin has been uploaded, I apologize 
for like of Sims Skin Updates... I have a lot more in the works, still waiting 
on a few more pieces... Here's a Koming Soon pic... There's more on the way than 
that btw.<br>
<i>(pic deleted due to routine cleaning)</i><hr color="#333333">
03/02/05 - Shao Kahn and Goro's bios are complete! Finally!!! Their Finishing 
moves have ALL been documented on their bios, as well as on the Movelist page.<hr color="#333333">
03/02/05 - Shao Kahn and Goro's bios have YET AGAIN been updated - Special Moves 
have been corrected, as well as the addition of their finishing moves. Their 
endings have also been added to Endings section (don't look until you beat the 
game for yourself). The Krypt Kontents has been updated with a few fixes here 
and there, plus the Gamecube changes to the Krypt have their own section within 
the Krypt page. Movelist has also been updated with Kahn and Goro's moves. 
Working slowly to get the site to where I want it. Tremor's SIMS SKIN (from 
MK:SF) is coming soon (yippee!...) and expect an odd page to be coming to the 
site soon... That's all I can say...<hr color="#333333">
02/23/05 - Shao Kahn and Goro's bios have again been updated - Their Special 
Moves are up, however they are UNTESTED, so I will get around to that as soon as 
the GC version of the game comes out. Only their fatalities are left to find.<hr color="#333333">
02/05/05 - Shao Kahn and Goro's bios have been updated again, with more insight 
to their storyline for the game. And while I reported them as being &quot;complete&quot; 
last update, well I still need to get their finishers and special moves updated. 
(kinda forgot) I'll update as soon as I get some more info. I have a few updates 
coming soon... Nothing major, just something to help out. Stay Tuned. The Sims 
section unfortunately won't be updated for awhile, my left hand is currently not 
in best working condition. I had a fight with a computer, and the computer won. 
Don't feel like doing much 3 stitches later...<hr color="#333333">
01/28/05 - Shao Kahn and Goro's bios for MK Deception are now complete, I'm 
unsure of whether the GC version of MKD is using these bios or not, but until I 
know otherwise, it's all I have to write down... On a related subject, the 
finished version of Shao Kahn will look &quot;sorta&quot; different than previous 
versions, he does not appear as his MK2/MK3 self, or as he appeared in Konquest, 
it looks as if he's wearing armor more resembling the Dragon King's armor - 
which closely resembles Scorpion's armor as well... weird... also on the newest 
picture of Shao Kahn that I've seen, his &quot;horns&quot; on his helmet are almost 
identical to the &quot;horns&quot; that Raiden now has on his hat. Wrap your mind around 
that until MK7 comes out... (PS - I'm going to be busy this month but I'll try 
to check in as often as I can with updates - l8tr!)<hr color="#333333">
01/19/05 - Shao Kahn and Goro's bios for MK Deception have been updated.<hr color="#333333">
01/19/05 - Did some minor touch up work to the site.<hr color="#333333">
01/18/05 - (Five minutes before 01/19/05, lol.) The MK Sims Skins section has 
been updated again - MK2 Johnny Cage and MK Trilogy Johnny Cage are now 
available for download. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
01/18/05 - 2 new kharacters added to the Mortal Kombat Deception section. Check 
that out, and also the MK2 and MK3 Jax skin for The Sims are now available for 
download. Enjoy the update!<hr color="#333333">
01/17/05 - MK Sims Skins Update: MK2 Noob Saibot is now available, ALL UMK3 Male 
Ninjas have been updated and look GREAT if you ask me. We also have a re-do of 
Sub-Zero for MK4. (Also: MK1 and MK2 Male Ninjas have been slightly touched up.)<hr color="#333333">
01/15/05 - No new updates yet - however I have a redesign of several Sims to be 
coming out shortly. I thought that the MK1 and MK2 ninja Sims seemed too rushed. 
I wasn't happy with the skin underneath their arms looking all weird, so I fixed 
that on all the skins, plus I made the MK1 Sims heads look much nicer. I've also 
figured out how to add in custom hands to the skins ('bout time) so expect some 
updates to people like Noob Saibot, Quan Chi, and Reptile who have different 
color hands. I will go back later and fix people's gloves. Too much work for one 
man, whew. Also going to update all of the UMK3 Ninjas to look more better than 
they do now. I believe that's all... any more I'll update later.<hr color="#333333">
01/14/05 - MK Sims Skins Update - MK2 Liu Kang!!! Check it out!!<hr color="#333333">
01/11/05 - Hiryu has joined me in up keeping the site. He is now at work on the 
UMK3 section, as well as a few other things for the site. I also updated the 
UMK3 Male Ninjas, nothing major tho, just some graphical errors with the faces, 
but it was something that was bothering me for some time. Also a note for those 
who didn't know, - most Sims that I update are compatible with their original 
files - meaning that you can &quot;upgrade&quot; your existing files to match the new 
ones. There are a few exceptions however. I wish I could be more help with that, 
but there's not much that can be done in some situations. Anyway. Keep visiting!<hr color="#333333">
01/09/05 - The MK Sims Section has been updated with these additions: MK1 
Scorpion, MK1 Sub-Zero, MK1 Reptile, MK2 Shang Tsung, MK2 Scorpion (Update), MK2 
Sub-Zero (Update), MK2 Reptile (Update), MK2 Smoke (Update), UMK3 Kitana 
(Update), UMK3 Mileena (Update), UMK3 Jade (Update), MKMS Sareena, MKMS Kia, 
MKMS Jataaka, MK4 Johnny Cage, MK4 Jarek, MK4 Kai, MK4 Reptile, MK4 Quan Chi, 
MK4 Sonya, and MK4 Tanya (Update). (whew...)<hr color="#333333">
01/09/05 - The total of MK Sims Skins that need to be added to the site is now 
27. I have also updated MK2's Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Smoke. And they 
look great. I'm considering updating the site with what I have now, and leaving 
the unfinished updates to be done later... Dunno... Considering it.<hr color="#333333">
01/08/05 - The total of MK Sims Skins has jumped to 23 tonight! 4 of Which are 
updates, but the rest are totally new. Here's a list of who's coming shortly:

<br>
<br>
(23) - as of 01/08/05. (Might be more tomorrow...)<br>
Here's a quit shot of the skins that are coming soon:<br>
<i>(pic deleted due to routine cleaning)</i><hr color="#333333">
01/07/05 - Adding to the 10 already created Sims needing to be uploaded, I also 
started and finished 5 last night. Making the total to be updated around 15. (2 
or 3 are updates, but damn do they look good) Still waiting on the Raiden head 
mesh. If anybody could send me a Japanese Peasant Hat Sims mesh for an adult 
male, it would help me out. I've looked everywhere for one with no luck. But I 
promise that even after the Raiden Sims are finished, I'll still continue making 
Sims Skins at a good rate until all MK Skins from MK1 through MK4 are available. 
MKDA and MKD skins will probably take a lot longer to complete... Oh and I also 
realize that certain game aspects of this website are... incomplete... I will 
work on that. As soon as I'm finished with the Sim Skins... Hey, I'm only one 
person. This is hard work for just one person.<hr color="#333333">
01/06/05 - MK SIMS UPDATE - While awaiting a custom built Raiden Head Mesh for 
the Sims, I've decided to start working on some other Sims at the same time... 
I'm going to update the site with these all at once as soon as I'm done with the 
Raiden Sims. However if it takes too long for the Raiden skins to be finished, 
I'm going to update the site with the skins that I've been working on while 
waiting for it's completion. We're talking like 10+ skins here, I started AND 
completed 5 or 6 last night. I was on a roll. And they all look much better than 
I anticipated. I'm also considering redoing the MK2 Ninja skins, as my 
techniques have refined themselves since I made those. Just a thought tho... I'm 
also considering putting two in-page frames on the index page - one being a list 
of updates for the site concerning MK material, and one concerning Sims 
material, since I realize that not all MK fans are Sims fans as well. (Imagine 
That) And I am taking skin requests at the moment. I would also like to say 
thanks for all the e-mail I've been getting. At times I think that I'm doing 
this all for my own self indulgence, but then I realize that there are people 
out there who appreciate the site despite the fact that it's not all flashy and 
whatnot, and a little e-mail now and again keeps me going - peace out.<hr color="#333333">
<i>(pic deleted due to routine cleaning)</i> 01/05/05 - Skins Koming Soon<hr color="#333333">
<center><a name="2004"><font size="3"><b>2004</b></font></a></center>
<hr color="#333333">
12/06/04 - Sims Skins has been updated - Jax from MK4 is finally available. And 
fans of Noob Saibot will be glad to hear that his costumes from both UMK3 and MK 
DECEPTION have also been added!<hr color="#333333">
12/04/04 - Sorry for lack of updates. The MK Fan Movie section is up. Been busy 
with a lot of things, have a few SIMS to update, just haven't got around to 
uploading them yet. Have a lot of stuff going on. I apologize for not having 
more team-members. It's just me. On a good note... well, just look at the MK fan 
Movie Section.<hr color="#333333">
10/17/04 (Another Update!) - MKD Movelist Complete!! ALL MKD Bios Updated!! 
FATALITY AND HARA-KIRI DESCRIPTIONS!!! MKD ENDINGS PAGE UPDATED!!! MORE KOMING 
SOON!!<hr color="#333333">
10/17/04 - MKD Krypt updated, and 100% complete and tested. MKD Movelist is 
being upgraded... check back soon. Two of my friends are helping me with the 
site now, so expect a few things to improve here and there. Major bio updates 
for ALL MKD Kharacters are Koming soon, Komplete with ALL Special Moves and 
Fatality/Hara-Kiri combinations that have been tested and proven reliable, plus 
Fatality and Hara-Kari descriptions!! Also working on a &quot;Arenas&quot; page, plus &quot;Konquest&quot; 
Page, and to top it off, I'm designing a MKD Noob Saibot with both primary and 
alternate outfits for The Sims. Oh and Jax from MK4 for The Sims. Can't forget 
about him... I think that's about it. Pretty good for being away for a week huh? 
I didn't forget about the fans!<hr color="#333333">
10/11/04 - MKD Krypt uploaded, MKD Movelist complete except for fatality 
descriptions. Tanya and Noob-Smoke bios updated and completed. Liu Kang's bio is 
currently the only bio that is not completed. Any errors in krypt must be 
reported back to me ASAP!!<hr color="#333333">
10/08/04 - Liu Kang's Fatalities and Hari-Kiri are up. One of Liu Kang's 
fighting styles is up, the 2nd coming sometime soon (possibly today), plus his 
weapon style is up. So the only things needed now are Liu Kang's Alignment, 
Allies, and Foes, and Kobra's 2nd Fatality and Hara-Kiri, and the Bios/Movelist 
will be done. Oh yeah, the MKD movelist has been updated as well. Many people 
who are downloading the Krypt Guides from places on the Internet will be 
disappointed to know that some of the information on the guides are incorrect, 
so I'm going through the Krypt that I have, and I'm correcting it. It will be 
available as soon as I'm done with it, which won't be too long from now if I 
keep at it the way that I am. ;)<hr color="#333333">
10/07/04 - Tanya's bio is complete. Raiden's special Moves are up. Liu Kang's 
special moves are up. The only things I need now are Liu Kang's bio info, 
Kobra's 2nd fatality and Hara-Kiri, Liu Kang's Fatalities and Hara-Kiri. Somehow 
I forgot to mention those earlier... but still the list is growing fast. Expect 
a Krypt, Konquest, and Kodes section to be opening soon.<hr color="#333333">
10/05/04 - Huge Update!! - I have all bio data for every character in Deception 
(Minus Tanya and Liu Kang, plus the 2 secret people), which includes their <b>
first appearance, origin, alignment, allies, foes, styles, weapon, official 
Midway bio + official strategy guide 1st person bio, special moves, fatalities, 
and hara-kiri's.</b> My site is the first site out there with all this data so 
easily accessible. I've updated the pics for every character who didn't have a 
really great bio pic for MK Deception. The Mortal Kombat Deception Kharacter Bio 
Section is near completion. Here is a list of <u>completed bios</u>:<br>
Scorpion<br>
Mileena<br>
Baraka<br>
Sub-Zero<br>
Kabal<br>
Ermac<br>
Nightwolf<br>
Bo' Rai Cho<br>
Ashrah<br>
Dairou<br>
Kobra<br>
Darrius<br>
Jade<br>
Kenshi<br>
Sindel<br>
Havik<br>
Raiden<br>
Li Mei<br>
Noob-Smoke<br>
Shujinko<br>
Hotaru<br>
Kira<br>
<br>
And <u>Unfinished Bios</u>:<br>
01.) Tanya<br>
(Need confirmation on alignment, plus ally/foe list)<br>
02.) Liu Kang<br>
(Need alignment, Ally/Foe lists, Styles/Weapon, Special Moves/Finishers, 
official story bio '<i>I have his first person bio which comes from the strategy 
guide</i>' plus a better picture of him than the one I have)<br>
03.) Dragon King<br>
(Just need to fix his page, it's treated more like a playable character bio 
rather than a boss bio, plus I'd like to use that one render I saw of him, I 
believe I have that somewhere...)<br>
<br>
I started the Deception section to gain and spread data for MK Deception, and 
while I was not the first to get the data out, I'm certainly the first to 
organize it <b>all</b> for the fans, so I hope you guys enjoy this, I take great 
pride in my site.<hr color="#333333">
10/04/04 - The Mortal Kombat Deception Kharacter Bio Section is almost fully 
komplete. I'm only missing a few things here and there, but check it out 
anyways.<hr color="#333333">
10/03/04 - I've started a new affiliation program for the site, and 2 members 
have officially joined: The Sonya Site and MKForces.Net. I've also updated the 
MK Deception section a bit, if nobody's noticed, all bios are up - most are 
complete - some are not. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
09/29/04 - I finished and uploaded the MK3 Sonya skin to the Sims section, so 
check her out and download her if you wish. I had help making this Sim from 
Edslightbulb from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sonyasite/">The Sonya Site</a>. 
She is my new affiliate for the Mortal Kombat: Komplete Strategy Guide site. 
Check her site out, it's in the early stages of being put together. Oh and 
expect a few changes to the site to be happenin' shortly...<hr color="#333333">
<i>(pic deleted due to routine cleaning)</i><br>
Left to Right: Mileena, Rain, Baraka, Smoke, Motaro, Kintaro, Ermac, Reiko, Shao 
Kahn, Reptile, Kano, and Sheeva.<br>
09/25/04 - I dunno if anybody's seen this or not, but it's a pic of MK Deception 
Kharacters that will be appearing in Konquest. Also, I'm going to update the MK 
Deception section with better pics of almost all of the characters, plus I'm 
going to upload all bios to the net, despite how much or how little information 
I have available. Hopefully this section will be completed soon.<hr color="#333333">
09/18/04 - I updated the Sims page with MK4 Tanya, and MKTM (The Movie) 
Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Reptile! I also updated ALL MK2 and UMK3 ninjas, making 
their dark colors darker, making their main colors stand out better. Enjoy.<hr color="#333333">
09/12/04 - I updated the MK Deception page with 3 new bios - Ashrah, Bo Rai Cho, 
and Kira<hr color="#333333">
09/07/04 Part 2 - I also updated the Sims page with MK4 Sub-Zero and Noob 
Saibot, plus UMK3 Kitana, Mileena, and Jade. After finally replacing all the old 
fuzzy JPEG pics with clearer GIF images, I changed the background and added a 
snazzier new logo. Any more suggestions/comments?<hr color="#333333">
09/07/04 Part 1 - I updated the MK Deception Kharacter Bios section, sorry no 
additional character bios, however I reorganized the pics, and separated the 
Selectable Kharacters from the Unlockable Kharacters. Soon I will possibly 
update again with a &quot;Hidden Kharacters&quot; section as well... And for those who 
don't know, most of the bios for Deception don't work, but some do...<hr color="#333333">
09/02/04 - I updated the MK SIMS section today! The Mortal Kombat Annihilation 
movie Skins are here!!<hr color="#333333">
03/07/04 - Nope, I'm not dead. Wow, close to 18,000 and some visitors. I'm glad 
everyone is enjoying the site dispight my lack of updates, and I apologize for 
that, but fret not. In the coming days I'm going to update the site with links 
outside of this site to other sites with information concerning UMK3, MKT, MK4, 
and MKG. This is going to be &quot;temporary&quot; until I &quot;eventually&quot; get the other 
sections up. I am just so busy with other things that I don't really have much 
time to update this site. However if anybody's interested, I did make the MIDI 
navigation a little easier, and for people who don't listen to the MIDI's anyway 
(I'm not sure many people do...) I've given them their own special link at the 
Index page, so they don't have to load the music page. In effect, saving 
download time and screen space. So that's that. Oh yeah and I have some free 
time from now until beginning of next month so here's the deal - I want to know 
what you think about the site. I want some suggestions. And for about a month, I 
will focus my energy on this site primarily. Take it or leave it. I need 
suggestions on how to lower the bandwidth consumption of this site. Has anyone 
experienced not being able to log into the site for some reason? Because I've 
been over my bandwidth limit 148 times this month alone... usually only 2 or 4 
hours a day, but if it's giving people trouble accessing my page then guess 
what. I'm gonna fix it. So I need suggestions. Do I possibly have too many pics, 
pages, or what? I know the MKDA endings page is Gi-Normous but I don't want to 
get rid of it. What do you think?<br>

08/22/03 - I apologize for continued inactivity in getting the other MK sections 
up and running as I've been having problems with my computer for awhile, and 
I've lost all data on 2 of my hard drives. Anybody willing to donate time to get 
the other sections up and running is welcome to it. Contact me.<hr color="#333333">
07/21/03 - The MK3 section is fully uploaded. Enjoy. I'm missing some info on 
fighting Smoke and Noob Saibot without kodes. I forgot how to do that. If 
anybody wants to clue me in, e-mail me. MK4 section koming soon...<hr color="#333333">
07/21/03 - Ok, the MK3 section is finally up (whew) there are a few sections in 
it that are not complete yet including - Smoke, Motaro, and Shao Kahn's bios. 
Plus the Kodes section. But the Endings section is up and lookin' good. I'll get 
the other pages up shortly.<hr color="#333333">
07/15/03 - I know what you're thinking. And no, I'm not dead. I've just been 
very busy on a Duke Nukem 3D Total Conversion and haven't had any time to work 
on many sites. But I'm starting on finishing the MK3 section today and if there 
are any people who know what they're doing with HTML and would like to help me 
complete the site then send an e-mail and we'll talk biznus. Because I really 
want to get the site finished but I'm only one person and I've got a million 
things to do. So throw me a line if you want to help the MK community out. 
Peace.<hr color="#333333">
05/30/03 - Part 2 - Whew. After finally getting the MK2 section finished and 
uploaded I said &quot;why not&quot; and finished the MK1 section as well. If anybody has 
better information than I currently do in the MK1 section or the MK2 section 
then please tell me and I'll update the site plus give you credit for it. Oh 
yeah, and by accident I put the offical fatalities on the MK1 section, and 
forgot that the SNES version had different fatalities for some of the fighters. 
I'll fix that at a later time (Whoopsy!) Keep it real. I'm going to sleep. I'm 
tizired.<hr color="#333333">
05/30/03 - Sorry for the lack of updates. It's been exactly 1 month since I've 
updated the site. Sorry, been really busy with other sites. The MK2 section is 
FINALLY uploaded thank goodness. The others will follow soon. I'm going to 
redesign the MKDA section slightly for better navigation. I promise that won't 
take a month to complete. Well, enjoy the MK2 section and thanks for the 
support. Later. The hit counter is currently at 9730. Only 270 more hits needed 
to reach the big 10000 mark. Rock on.<hr color="#333333">
04/30/03 - I've redesigned the site's layout a bit. Hope you like it. We have 
great things planned out for the future - stay tuned. The Unofficial Mortal 
Kombat Deadly Alliance site is now the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Komplete Strategy Guide&quot; 
website. Other sections will be opened as soon as completion.<hr color="#333333">
