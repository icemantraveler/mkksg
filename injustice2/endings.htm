&quot;Superman was right. Brainiac needed to die. But I couldn't stomach the idea 
of Kal's return to power. Atlantis would not again be his vassal. With Batman 
beaten and his allies imprisoned, I couldn't muster the force I needed to 
take Superman down. I'd all but lost hope when my marines discovered an 
abandoned Insurgent base hidden in the Southern Ocean. Here Lex Luthor 
perfected his inter-universe transporter. From plans left behind, my scientists 
built a new device. Now I go and ask for the help of those I had fought. I 
must also ask their forgiveness.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;My punishment of Brainiac's crimes had unintended consequences. His death 
disabled his ship. Billions of collected souls perished. I did not know they 
could be restored. Their deaths unleashed such rage. My Red Lanterns were 
overwhelmed. They drove me from Ysmault. They would have killed me, if not for 
Proselyte. The emotional entity offered me compassion, not rage, in the face 
of my grave error. I now understand the emotional spectrum requires balance. My 
Red Lanterns' rage must punish the worst offenders. But it cannot blindly 
consume those who deserve compassion.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Who would have ever imagined a sickly boy born in a prison would survive to 
become humanity's savior? I did. And now the world is mine. So I say to all 
prisoners... Rise! Come out! Kill your wardens! Make slaves of your guards. 
Teach them the meaning of despair! We have no more prisons, no police, no Regime 
left to fight... [Sighs] No one left to fight. Any worthy opponent has 
already... fallen... Dios mio. Perhaps victory can be a prison. A possibility I 
never imagined...&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Brainiac's attack left the world devastated. Thousands dead, many more 
thousands homeless. When President Kane asked that I head up the emergency 
response, I couldn't refuse. The job's demands required that I leave the Justice 
League in Barry's and Hal's hands. Together they're molding the younger heroes 
into a force for good unlike any Earth has even seen. But I'm only semi-retired. 
Behind the scenes, I've been preparing for Superman's return. Kal swore he'd 
escape from the Phantom Zone. I'd be foolish not to take him at his word.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;I returned to find Kahndaq devastated from Brainiac's attack. My beloved 
queen was dead. I brought her broken body to the Lazarus Pits, intent on her 
resurrection. But my entry was barred by Ra's Al Ghul. He offered a trade: 
access to the pits in exchange for my aid in bringing him to power. Ra's admired 
Superman's regime, but felt it should have gone further. While I have no 
love for Ra's, I accepted his terms. I will pay any price to again feel the 
embrace of my dearest wife.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;I'd have loved to kick back and savor kicking Brainiac's ass, but I had to 
rush home. I didn't know if Connor had made it out of the invasion OK. Turns out 
I didn't need to worry. The crazy stress of Brainiac's attack had activated 
my son's metagene, and if there's one thing you don't want to mess with, it's a 
scared, pissed-off three-year-old with superpowers. Sure I love that Connor 
takes after me, but... raising him suddenly got a lot more complicated. I'm just 
glad to have people around that can help me and Ollie figure this whole 
thing out.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Oh, man-- dude!-- I cannot even describe what it felt like! Sure, I was just 
the newb in the crew. But like, you think I'd ever let Brainiac kill Batman, and 
what, blow up the world? No manches! When it was over, Batman was all-- 
(clears throat, imitates Batman:) &quot;The world is safe thanks to you, Jaime. I'd 
like to make you LEADER of the new Justice League, if that's cool with you.&quot; 
Wow! That was a really tempting offer, you know. But if there's one thing better 
than saving Batman, it's saving mi familia. I haven't been around them much 
since I got the Scarab. So for now, I'm moving home and going back to school. 
And if this so-called &quot;normal&quot; life doesn't work out? There's always the 
Justice League.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

Brainiac</a></b> (Boss/Unlockable - Complete Story Mode)<hr color="#1A1A1A">
 &quot;Obviously Batman and Superman have many questions. Where did I come from? Why 
am I here? Am I friend or foe? It is time to reveal the truth.<br><br>I'm 
Brainiac 5. A descendant of the original Brainiac, but without his homicidal 
tendencies. In the future, people fear Coluans because of my ancestor. So I 
elected to come back in time and fix that. Now that I'm done, I'm going back 
where I belong--the 31st century. The Legion of Super-Heroes will grill me for 
&quot;borrowing&quot; a time bubble. But all they really need to know is that I'm on their 
side, and always will be. Long live the Legion!&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Going after the Regime was one thing. But destroy the planet for Brainiac? 
You really thought I'd go through with it, Grodd? Really?! [BLEEP!] you! Sorry 
it's been a while, sis. I know I've always got an excuse. But this time, I-I 
finally figured out the right way to honor your memory. I know what you're 
thinking. &quot;Old Lenny sold out.&quot; So what? I'm making sure the Regime and 
Brainiac never happen again. Even buried the hatchet with old Scarlet Speedster. 
Ironically or whatever, he's the best partner I ever had. 'Sides you, sis.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

&quot;With nine lives, it had to happen sooner or later. I got everything I ever 
wanted, including a handsome prince and a badass reputation as the woman who 
beat Brainiac. And I must say... I was bored to death. Bruce and I worked 
better when we were forbidden. When the masks were on and the claws were out. 
That honeymoon was over, so I did the best thing for both of us. I'm not 
sad. I didn't become Catwoman to bag Bruce Wayne. I don't ever want to rely on 
anyone but myself. I'll go where I want to go, take what I want to take. And 
never, ever look back.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Hungry for his blood, I prepared to claim Brainiac. But the alien, desperate 
to save his life, sputtered out an offer. Brainiac said that if I spared him, 
he'd deposit any of his collected beings I wanted on a world of my choosing. 
There, I could pursue them at my leisure. So now I hunt, free from Wonder 
Woman's interference. With each kill, I glorify the Goddess. As for 
Brainiac? Of course I didn't abide our agreement. I'd never given up on killing 
him. A true huntress always catches her prey.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Brainiac thought he had me all figured out. Said my humanity made me weak. 
But fighting for humanity gave me the strength to body that punk-ass Coluan. And 
before he dropped, I took a few things... His twelfth-level intellect and 
his ship's data core. I thought the Internet was gigantic. But now? I've got the 
whole wide universe at my fingertips. First up, I put back every Earth city 
Brainiac stole, starting with my hometown, The Motor City! Then I keep going... 
Superman wants to secure one world, but I can reboot tens of thousands! 
Every last one in Brainiac's Collection. Gonna be a long trip. But another 
benefit of my new twelfth-level intellect is I can reunite with some old 
friends. Titans Together. Boo-yah.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Grodd used the damned nano-explosive in my head to make me his bitch. The 
jobs he made me do... well, let's just say they crossed some lines. I bet taking 
Brainiac and Grodd into the authorities would beat doing another stretch in 
Belle Reve... and I was right. Bruce Wayne even bankrolled getting rid of my TNT 
migraines for good. I frickin' hate hospitals, but god, was it worth it. 
With that nano safely out, I could finally see Zoe again. Last time I saw my 
little girl, she had nine candles on her birthday cake. Now I gotta second 
shot at being dad-- and I sure as hell don't plan to miss it.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;The Lords of Order believed Earth couldn't be saved. That only Brainiac's 
evil could restore order. I knew refusing the Lords' Fate would anger them, and 
that they'd try to destroy me. Anyone else would have nowhere to run. 
Fortunately, I still have friends in low places. The House of Mystery guards the 
Helm. Zatanna and Constantine's spells conceal me from the Lords. But it was 
John's daughter, Rose, who gave me the greatest gift of all. My wife, Inza, 
returned to life and in my arms again. For the first time since taking up 
the Helm, I don't know what tomorrow will bring. And that is... perfect.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;The professor and me worked our tails off to control our powers. But Stein 
figured out the only way to beat Brainiac was to lose control.<br><br>I 
correctly calculated that overheating Brainiac's engines would weaken him. But 
the quantum disruption we created caused an... unexpected chain reaction... The 
Skull Ship exploded... and every city Brainiac stole from Earth was 
obliterated. Metropolis. Coast City. All of them.<br><br>We thought we'd finally 
be the big heroes. The ones everyone looks up to.<br><br>But in our hubris, we 
lost sight of the hero's duty: protecting others at all costs.<br><br>And we 
can't make that kinda mistake again.<br><br>But still, if you ever need us, 
Batman...<br><br>We'll be here.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;So much for heroes. Brainiac had barely hit the floor when the arguing 
started. Should we kill him? Keep him alive? I couldn't watch them go to war. 
Not again. So I ran -- into the speed force! Brainiac wanted the universe to 
himself, so I dropped him off at the end of history. But I still kept running. I 
needed to be alone. Then I heard a familiar voice... It was Jay -- and the 
other speedsters! A crisis is coming, he told me! But if we run fast enough, 
together, we just might save the Multiverse. I thought I'd been running 
away. But I was running toward something. It's good to believe in heroes again.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;The befuddled look frozen on Brainiac's dead face is a vision I will always 
relish. Even as I ripped the head from his body, the alien couldn't believe that 
an ape was taking his life. {Laughs} I quickly mastered Brainiac's 
technology, exponentially increasing my telepathic power. Then I enslaved 
Earth's humans, finally relegating them to their proper place. But my 
victory over those vermin was only the beginning. Now fully in command of 
Brainiac's vast powers, I am the greatest conqueror the Universe has ever 
seen. All worlds will kneel before Emperor Grodd.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Taking down that green-skinned bastard got me thinking about the people of my 
Earth. My universe's Brainiac had never come calling. I had to warn them. By the 
time I got home, it was too late. My Earth was *this* close to being gone 
for good. But that's when the strangest cavalry you've ever seen rode in. It was 
a full-on, multiverse Justice League! They'd been hopping between universes, 
battling Brainiac in every one. I couldn't refuse when they asked me to join. 
I've seen what Brainiac can do. Nobody, in any universe, should have to face 
that threat again.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;The Guardians ordered me to bring Brainiac to Oa to stand trial. I was plenty 
happy to put a few thousand light years between that alien and Earth. After the

outta their ScienceCells. A frontal assault on the Sinestro Corps was a no go. 
Us Greens were still weak from fighting Superman's regime. That's why I 
volunteered to go undercover-- as a Yellow Lantern. To pass, I need to 
re-embrace my fear. But fear's an addiction. Once I've picked up that 
bottle, it's gonna be awfully hard putting it back down again. I just hope I 
have the will to see it through.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

every now and again, every once in a while, I get this irresistible urge to go 
out and BASH SOME HEADS! Hopefully, being good'll stick long term. Till I'm

 &quot;I hadn't begun my day thinking I'd give a wannabe alien overlord a haircut. 
That was a happy accident. But what I first thought a distraction inspired my 
life's greatest work. I found Brainiac's collection. Those poor cities from 
across the universe, trapped aboard his ship. There was only one thing to do! I 
restored them. And gave Earth the reboot it so desperately needed! I 
stitched together a crazy quilt of alien civilizations, without regard to rhyme 
or reason. Afraid, confused, devolved to their basest instincts, they kill 
each other in the most sickening ways. And I get to sit back, munch popcorn, and 
enjoy the show -- watching as the world burns! Hehehehahahahaha!&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Of all the men I've charmed, Brainiac was the most useful. With his help, I 
finally slaughtered the so-called heroes. Then I whispered in his ear, &quot;Collect 
every last city on Earth, and I'll give you a kiss&quot;. And he did it. Every 
last city. I finally brought human civilization crashing to the ground. As for 
Brainiac, he got the kiss he deserved. But he was just a fling. After all, I 
was going to be busy leading the green... I should've know there'd be some 
competition. Swamp Thing's sympathy for humans makes him weak. The plants 
know I'm their real guardian. And when the leaves settle, there will be no 
doubt-- this world is mine.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Bruce Wayne was my father, and it's no secret I hated him. But despite all 
that, he sacrificed himself to save me. Giving me the chance to stop Brainiac 
permanently. I was so obsessed with escaping the bat's shadow, that I never 
appreciated what that symbol really meant. Not until I saw it stained with my 
father's blood. My blood. This symbol is my legacy, a legacy of vengeance. 
My name is Damian Wayne, son of Bruce, grandson of the demon. I've been called 
Robin, and Nightwing. But from now on, the world will know me as... Batman.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;After studying Brainiac's blood, I tweaked my fear toxin to exploit his alien 
biology. And as I gained control of his shattered mind, I also gained control of 
his ship. I began to explore Brainiac's enormous collection, soon realizing 
it was an unprecedented opportunity for study. Billions of species, from 
millions of worlds. Each with its own phobias and fears. Now, the Skull Ship 
is my laboratory. As it glides through the vast darkness of space, its collected 
beings are subjected to their worst nightmares. With each I study, my 
knowledge grows. It may take decades, but I will become the universe's greatest 
master of fear.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

want to give the world he stole a second chance. But bonding with Brainiac's 
ship is too risky. I need a safer way to restore our cities. I'm so glad for 
the Justice League's help. Barry, Professor Stein--they've already taught me so 
much. Every day, we get closer to reversing Brainiac's collection process. 
When we do, we'll pick the right star system. What Brainiac ruined will be 
reborn--Argo City and Kandor, twin cities, survivors. I couldn't save 
Kal-El. But I will save our people.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

so much more. Millions of civilizations await rebirth in Brainiac's 
collection. I'll find the bravest and strongest warriors among them, and I'll 
start a new Regime. No, a new Legion. The Legion of Superheroes! With it, 
I'll bring peace not just to Earth, but to the entire universe! And the 
universes that lie beyond!&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Many throughout history have underestimated the green. In this way, Brainiac 
was no different than Superman or Batman. They all thought they could improve 
upon nature. They all were wrong. Earth belonged to the green for eons 
before animals evolved. Now, the trees and plants will remind these animals upon 
whose planet they reside. When the next crisis comes, nature will protect 
itself. I stand with the green, and the green alone.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

The people begged for deliverance-- and I gave them Brainiac's head. Once 
again, it falls upon the Regime to restore peace and order. Batman and the 
traitors who followed him will be punished. Even Kara Zor-El. Then I will 
return to Themyscira-- and deal with my sisters. If they do not heed my 
commands, they will bow to force. So says Diana, princess of the Amazons, 
slayer of Brainiac!&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;The Coluan, Brainiac, was a genius without peer. But. I. Am. A God. I could 
not allow an errant intellect to steal the object of my vengeance. Superman 
refused to submit to my will, denied my conquest of Earth, and killed my 
son, Kalibak. He suffered and perished. But not until I told him exactly what 
would happen after he died. Kara Zor-El proved quite resilient, but 
eventually, DeSaad broke her. She is a powerful weapon--a natural leader for my 
new, invincible breed of parademons, cloned from the DNA of Superman 
himself. Superman robbed me of my blood. Now, our score is settled. That is the

kicker. Fastest, most explosive ammo in the world. I made them myself. With the 
invasion over, Bruce and Superman started fighting again. I wasn't down with 
either of them. On the one hand, the regime's right: scumbag murderers and 
rapists deserve to die. But on the other hand, I'm no fan of government 
authority. Especially the dictatorial variety. So, while the world's finest 
fight each other, I fight for the people, the weak, the innocent, anyone who 
can't protect themselves. When they cry out for a savior, I'll answer! As for 
the criminals that threaten them, they need to know that their actions have

 &quot;I arrived in this realm accidentally, driven here by magic unleashed as I 
forced Kotal Kahn's retreat from Earthrealm to Outworld. I was seeking a route 
home when Brainiac attacked. I could not allow this vile invader to add this 
planet, or myself, to his collection. In gratitude for my flawless victory, 
Batman offered the Justice League's aid. While I waited on him to unlock the 
magic of inter-realm travel, I provided valuable kombat training to the youngest 
members of his order. But the spells that were devised went awry. Instead of 
opening a portal to Earthrealm, they opened a gateway to the Phantom Zone. Now I 
fight to re-imprison Superman and his followers. They would not have been

 &quot;Back in the day, this victory would have called for a party in the Titans' 
Tower. The music, the laughter, the mustard with pizza on bottom. But these 
days, I have no party mates. Raven became a servant of Trigon. Cyborg, he 
joined the regime. Beast Boy has been missing for so long, I must assume he is 
dead. Dick Grayson... he was my star- crossed soulmate. He will never be 
replaced. And now... all that's left is me, last of the Titans. Dick would not 
approve of the moping. I only overcame the loss of Tamaran by coming to 
Earth and forging new bonds of friendship with the Titans. It is incumbent upon 
me to repeat history. To forge new bonds of friendship. Maybe they're not my 
Titans, but the only way I know to honor my lost friends is to make sure 
that no matter what, that we'll always be Titans together. After all, I beat 
Brainiac. That was a victory, and victories call for mustard parties.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Brainiac stole Atlantis. For that, I could have thanked him. But that wasn't 
enough. Arthur Curry's kingdom had to be wiped from history. Forgotten. Lost. As 
it should be. I found just the place, guarded by Earth's most savage 
predators. Once upon a time, Arthur Curry killed my father. Now that I've killed 
his kingdom, all that remains is to kill &quot;the King&quot; himself. Only then will 
I consider my father's murder avenged. Only then will I rest. And what of 
Aquaman? Does he come forward to avenge his own people? No. He hides behind 
an alien and an Amazon. Let him. It won't save him. Compared to that alien 
freak, Brainiac, these three will be fish for the slaughter. And when they're
<br>dead, the world can thank Black Manta.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Though I had finished Shinnok, his corruption of Earthrealm's Jinsei has 
cracked the barrier between my realm and this one. I began having visions of 
Brainiac's collection of this Earth. I realized that Brainiac's actions 
would soon destroy the barrier among all the realms. All life would be 
annihilated. With Brainiac dispatched, I tended the injured. His wounds too 
great, Kent Nelson could not be saved. But as he died, he warned me: the 
Armageddon I had foreseen was the design of the Lords of Order. By 
destroying reality, they would return the multiverse to a perfectly ordered 
state, obliterating Chaos. To defeat this powerful magic, the Justice League 
turned to this Earth's most proficient wizards and sorcerers. I gladly 
accepted the invitation to join them. The Lords will be contained, Order and 
Chaos will remain balance. Life as we know it, will continue.&quot;<hr color="#333333">

 &quot;Somehow, Brainiac shanghaied me on a slow boat to this universe. Bastard had 
big dreams about me in his &quot;Collection.&quot; Guess what I thought about that idea. 
Taking Brainiac out certainly got folk's attention. I got a lotta offers to 
stick around, but I got bored quick. Megalomaniac villains and tights-wearing 
heroes really aren't my thing. What's it they say? Home is where the heart 
is? But when I got back, things just weren't the same. The bureau was too small. 
Was time for me to hit the road. Africa was totally the right call. The wide 
open spaces suit me. Clean air, starry skies and, not surprisingly, more than a

He'll survive this minor brain surgery. He just won't be able to control his 
Skull Ship anymore. Crisis averted, I can get back to searching for my 
missing mentor, Professor Ray Palmer. Last year, Palmer dove headfirst into the 
Microverse, a subatomic dimension he himself discovered. In case he got 
lost, he left behind a trail of clues and designated an asthmatic research 
fellow, yours truly, to follow them. That trail's gone cold. Which is why 
I'm upgrading my bio-belt with Brainiac's technology. It's my turn to get 
subatomic. I'm not the strongest or bravest hero out there. But Professor 
Palmer? He's an Einstein- level genius. He trusted me with his astonishing

the old witch ate him alive. It was over. Brainiac was beaten. But even more 
miraculously, the Enchantress... was gone. After years of that witch feeding on 
me, torturing me, corrupting me... I'm free. No more aliases, no evil

shouldn't have surprised us that this new universe had its own intergalactic 
despot. We knew we had to stop Brainiac or else we--<br><br>Just skip to the

get a good pizza, and she's all, [Harley impression] &quot;Let me get you turtles
