<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I am a demon, a denizen of the Netherrealm. For ages, my sisters and I have blindly served Quan Chi as members of the Brotherhood of the Shadow. But I questioned a command given by the sorcerer. To set an example, he sent my own sister to slay me. During 
my escape, I discovered a weapon - a sword - that seemed to be of heavenly origin. With each demonic assassin that has fallen to this blade, I have felt a strange exhilaration. It is as if the taint of evil is leaving me.<br>
Now I understand the strange sensation I feel when I exterminate a demon of the Netherrealm with this sword. The sword is purifying me as I cleanse the world of evil. With each fiend I eradicate, my presence here becomes more unstable... Soon I will be expelled 
from this realm. If I were to slay a powerful demon such as Noob Saibot, I would finally become an ascending demon, free from the Netherrealm forever.&quot;<hr class="sub">

is strong! Invincible! We will slay all who oppose him! We will follow him to bloody victory!<br>
ONAGA! He has ordered us to ravage Outworld in order to distract the foolish allies and give him time to complete his plans. Mileena poses as Princess Kitana to confuse and misdirect the enemies of the Dragon King. She lies to them and tells them to attack 
our raiding parties. But our Lord will be nowhere near us. We draw their armies away from him. When my master's will is done, they will all be consumed!&quot;<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I have dealt with Tarkatan warriors before. Baraka and his mutant thugs were easy to evade as I entered Shang Tsung's palace to rescue Li Mei. I had arrived not a moment too soon. I snatched her away from the Deadly Alliance and swiftly carried her to 
safety. An alarm was sounded, and hordes of Tarkatan warriors pursued us across the main bridge.<br>
On the other side of the palace bridge, I was met by Earthrealm's thunder god, Raiden, and his band of heroes marching to battle the Deadly Alliance. I bid them a glorious victory, but my primary concern was Li Mei's safety. I have since learned of the disaster 
that took place at the palace. The Dragon King had indeed returned, as legends foretold. Without our Earthrealm allies, I fear for Outworld's future.&quot;<hr class="sub">

Foes: Hotaru<br>

Weapon: Autumn Dao<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I was once a member of the Seidan Guard. I believed in the power of the Order and lived by the strict codes of my superiors. I had saved many lives during my years of service. But when I killed an assailant in a fit of rage, I was arrested and sentenced 
to a life of incarceration. For all the good I had done, the event that had come to define me was that one moment of Chaos. I eventually escaped during a riot incited by the resistance.<br>
I emerged from the prison a changed man. No longer would I follow orders of the Seidan. Neither could I bring myself to give into Chaos. Instead, I opted to serve myself. I became a mercenary, a warrior for hire, and have become revered in Orderrealm's secret 
underground. My neutrality has been put to the test, however, as my current contract is to find and kill my former guardsman, Hotaru.&quot;<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I am Darrius. There are many in the Realm of Order who would call me a terrorist. But to the true patriots of Seidan, I am a hero. I fight against the rule of an oppressive regime. I am the leader of the resistance movement. Out number are ever-growing. 
One day I will lead the charge against the establishment. Until then, I wait... And plan... And scheme.<br>
One of the best recruitment tools I have discovered is the law itself. If my ranks are in need of a powerful warrior like a Seidan Guardsman, for instance, I will hire and outsider to kill the man's family in the hope that his rage will lead to a violent altercation 
with the assassin. Once he is imprisoned for the attack, I free the Seidan Guardsman and easily recruit him to our cause.&quot;<hr class="sub">

Weapon: Axe<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;We are Ermac. We are the fusion of the souls of dead warriors, created by Shao Kahn to obey him without question. We served as his enforcer for many years, until the Earthrealm warrior Kenshi released us from our bondage and awakened our perception of 
the worlds that surround us. We are now free to choose our own destiny.<br>
We encountered a fellow warrior spirit, who, like Kenshi, understood our suffering. Eager to atone for the atrocities we had committed in Shao Kahn's name, we agreed to help this warrior, Liu Kang, to liberate his allies from the control of the Dragon King. 
Shao Kahn may be dead, but it seems his essence lives on in this new menace. It is as if they are both manipulated by the very fabric of the realms.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;Chaos. The universe thrives on it. Forces pitted against each other in never-ending turmoil. My kind worships entropy. We wander the realms sowing disorder. My latest sojourn had brought me to Lei Chen, an Outworld city imprisoned by the one known as 
Hotaru. For many years he had kept Chaos at bay beyond the outer walls. I would undo the Order he had fought so hard to maintain.<br>
It was I who led the &quot;heroes&quot; to the location of the Dragon King. The Chaos that would ensue from their attack would be a blessing to this realm. Onaga must never gain the upper hand in this struggle. The realms shall never cease their struggle!

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;There is an order to the universe -- laws that all of nature must obey. For centuries I have imposed order on those who would wreak havoc. Outworld has long been a source of disruption, but an old ruler has made a triumphant return. During Onaga's rule, 
his military forced peace throughout his domain. I will see that his return brings order to this war-torn realm once more. I will fight against the insurgents to clear a path for the Dragon King's coming.<br>
Years ago, I fought against the vole Tarkatan warriors. I vowed to protect the Outworld city of Lei Chen from the attacks of Shao Kahn. Times have changed. Now I find myself aiding Baraka and his troops. I pledged the loyalty of the city to Onaga and began 
my mission to stop the uprising against him. Baraka's militia have brought word of an Earthrealm warrior named Sub-Zero who has slain many Tarkata. I will hunt him down. I will bring him before the justice of the Dragon King.&quot;<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I had arrived too late. Kitana and her allies from Earthrealm had been slain in an epic battle against the Deadly Alliance. At the least, they had killed many Tarkata before they died. As I knelt beside her, a menacing, dragon-like creature strode across 
the bridge to the palace. I leapt out of sight and watched as he resurrected the dead and ordered them to regroup near the Living Forest. I followed them in secret.<br>
The Dragon King's entourage crossed into Edenia and imprisoned Queen Sindel. He used Princess Kitana to guard her, knowing the Queen would not attack her own daughter. I fought Kitana and eventually managed to lock her in a cell of her own. Kitana screamed 
furiously, altering the enemy.<br>
Before Queen Sindel and I escaped through a portal to Outworld, I caught a last glimpse of the Dragon King... and at his side... Tanya!&quot;<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I had left the Black Dragon and all that it stood for... But to some I would forever remain associated with that despicable organization. Eventually, the Red Dragon clan found me, and I was defeated by Mavado. He left me for dead and took my hookswords 
as his trophies. As the life trickled from my body, a stranger rescued me: a cleric of Chaos who called himself Havik. He convinced me to return my clan to its former glory. Never again will I deny my devotion to the Black Dragon.<br>
Inspired by Havik, I set out to find and kill Mavado of the Red Dragon. His organization is secretive, but not invisible. It feels good to have hookswords in my hands once again. I have since recruited young, skillful warriors to fill the ranks of the new 
Black Dragon clan. I will now lead my fellow Dragons to Outworld, where Havik has a task for us. It will be an excellent opportunity to test the abilities of my young comrades -- and weed out the weak ones.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;I lay near death after my fight with the Red Dragon Mavado. But the ninja Sub-Zero found me and aided my recovery. As my wounds healed, the souls of my ancestors told me of their return to my sword. Their captor, Shang Tsung, was most certainly dead 
-- though I did not know how or by whom. Having no more reason to remain in Outworld, I made a temporary alliance with Sub-Zero, and we began our search for a way back to Earthrealm.<br>
Still weary, I traveled with Sub-Zero to the portal that had brought him to Outworld. I noticed that his armor was charred and worn from battle. He told me of a powerful warrior named Hotaru, a loyalist to a new ruler of this realm, who had attacked him for 
slaying a troop of Tarkatan militia. Sub-Zero thought he had defeated the warrior, but I am not so sure. I have sensed a presence following us for the past few days.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;I was the first of Kabal's recruits. I had stolen away to the mountains of Afghanistan, selling weapons to terrorists disguised as a man. When they discovered my gender, I had to fight my way out of the cave. I suppose Kabal assumed that any woman who 
could do business with cutthroat extremists organizations and live to talk about it must be worthy of his new Black Dragon clan. When I alone emerged from the cave, Kabal stood before me with an offer to join him.<br>
The complacency of the original Black Dragon allowed their destruction. Kabal claims that a new Black Dragon clan will rise from the ashes more ruthless, more calculated than before. We will not exist as a mere band of pirates. We will cause the downfall of 
civilization itself and live in a world of blessed anarchy.&quot;<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I had always wondered if my martial arts training would work in an actual fight. I trained in school for years. I was the best in my class. But we were never allowed to hurt each other -- REALLY hurt each other. How did I know this attack would break 
an arm? That this one would rupture an organ? I prowled the back alleys of New York in search of an opportunity to put my skills to the test. I needed to know what kombat really was.<br>
I couldn't stop. The thrill of kombat consumed me. I had killed! First it was drug dealers and gangbangers -- it allowed me to justify the violence. But the bloodlust grew. I killed for money, looting convenience stores and gas stations. When the law finally 
caught up with me, I couldn't remember how many had died. Sitting cuffed in the police car, I heard some of the officers shouting and firing their guns. When some chick and a masked guy with bloody hookswords stepped into the light, I knew I was in the company 
of friends.&quot;<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I had entered the tournament held by the Deadly Alliance in hopes of winning the freedom of my enslaved town -- I was a naive fool. Shang Tsung and Quan Chi had no intention of rewarding a victor. Instead they prepared to transplant my soul into the 
last remaining corpse of Onaga's ancient army. Had it not been for the surprise intervention of Master Bo' Rai Cho, I would have become a servant of evil.<br>
Master Bo' Rai Cho brought me back to health, and for this I am forever in his debt. The brief moment my soul occupied the warrior corpse changed me in ways I may never fully understand. Master Bo' Rai Cho has trained me well during the time I have spent with 
him, and I feel a sense of duty to Outworld like never before. But I cannot deny that I feel strangely drawn to a new power taking hold in this realm...&quot;<hr class="sub">

himself to stop Onaga. Raiden's blast destroyed Shang Tsung, and our souls were free to ascend into the heavens. I remained in Outworld, however, to aid my friends in the fight against the Dragon King.<br>
Why someone would desecrate my grave and reanimate my body, I cannot say. Somehow my corpse retains my knowledge of martial arts and has killed many innocents. Though I am not the perpetrator of these slaying, I cannot help but feel responsible for the brutality 
committed by my corporal form. The battle between mind and body has begun.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;I was well aware of Onaga, the former ruler of Outworld. Shao Kahn had been his advisor until he poisoned the Dragon King and stole Outworld for himself. But Onaga had somehow returned, more powerful than before. His powers seemed augmented by a force 
previously exhibited only by the Elder Gods. Even the might of the Deadly Alliance combined with my own could not defeat him. I did the only thing I could: I released my godlike essence in an attempt to destroy them all.<br>
By the time my energies reformed in Earthrealm, I was aware of all that had transpired. I became disgusted with the doings of mortals. It was Shujinko's vanity and desire for glory that had led to the return of the Dragon King. I will no longer allow the will 
of men to determine the fate of this realm. They will fight for it, or I will destroy them. All will fear the new God of Thunder.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;I was a fool. I had allowed myself to be deceived into believing that I worked for a greater good. I was in fact an unknowing tool of a greater evil. My ego allowed Onaga, the Dragon King, to manipulate me into bringing together the lost Kamidogu. They 
are the very weapons by which the Elder Gods smashed the One Being, forming the many realms we call existence. But their misuse can also bring the realms crashing together again... Reawakening the One Being... Unmasking all reality.<br>
The realms are the shattered consciousness of the One Being, who has been working subconsciously through the Dragon King. Should Onaga succeed in conquering reality by fusing the Kamidogu, he will unwittingly begin a cascade of events that will merge all the 
realms together. The One Being will become whole once more, and all other beings will cease to exist. I must find and unite the warriors of all the realms if I am to save us. I will use the Dragon King's gift against him.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;Once again Edenia had been invaded by an Outworld threat. The Dragon King flooded this realm with Tarkatan warriors and held me captive in my own prison. My only daughter, Kitana, had somehow become his slave and guarded me night and day. I remained 
captive, for I could not bring myself to assault her, even to regain my freedom. Thank the Elder Gods Jade did not share my apprehension.<br>
Jade and I escaped to Outworld to discover what we could about Onaga. He had been searching Edenia for... I know not what. I fear, however, that the knowledge left behind by Shao Kahn so many years ago may be his objective. That information should have been 
destroyed -- but if it still exists, it could spell disaster for the realms. I cannot save my daughter Kitana until I learn more about her captor.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;My fellow Lin Kuei, Frost, had betrayed me and stolen my Dragon Medallion. Unable to control the medallion's power, she was consumed by her own freezing ability. I searched Outworld for a suitable place to bury her remains when I happened upon ancient 
ruins carved into a mountainside.<br>
I learned that the ruins were a holy structure belonging to a lost race of people who had attained mastery over cold. After thorough study of this culture, I now believe both Frost and myself to be their descendants. I laid Frost's body in a sarcophagus and 
left the catacombs, donning the armor of my newly discovered heritage.&quot;<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;I had been called an enforcer of the Deadly Alliance. I preferred the term &quot;ambassador.&quot; It was my duty to impose the will of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung upon the denizens of Outworld. But the sorcerers' rule was short-lived and I found myself 
leaderless, longing to return to my birthplace in Edenia. When Baraka caught up with me, he gave me a choice: Serve his new lord of Outworld... Or die. I have lived for thousands of years because I make the right decisions. I pledged my service to the Dragon 
King.<br>
Onaga was aware of Shao Kahn's invasion of Edenia so many years ago. Apparently the Dragon King had been watching Shao Kahn from beyond death. Whatever the late emperor had been attempting, Onaga was determined to complete it. He was looking for lost information, 
ancient spells that would fuse the Elder Gods' six Kamidogu into one and therefore make it possible for him to wield their combined might. I brought him to Edenia, where I believed that information still existed.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;Kitana's army allied with my Shokan warriors in an attempt to destroy my old master, Shao Kahn. It was rumored that he was weakening and that our victory was inevitable. During the last battle against Kano's militia, however, I was attacked from behind 
by a shadow warrior, Noob Saibot. I do not know for how long I lay dying on the battlefield, but when I regained consciousness, I was greeted by the last person I expected to see...<br>
Shao Kahn found me near death upon the battlefield. Though he was not wearing his armor, I recognized his voice it was truly him. He used what little power he had left to revive me. He asked me to join him once again and aid in destroying a rising power in 
Outworld. In return, he would give the Shokan favored status and banish the Centaurs. I accepted his offer. I placed my royal seal on the disfigured corpse of a fallen Shokan warrior and together we fled into hiding to regain our strength for the coming battle.&quot;<hr class="sub">

long ago by my minions, I created a clone of myself to draw my enemies' attention while I escaped into the wild. When I have regained my strength, I will destroy all who have opposed my rule.<br>
Though I had gone to great lengths to ensure my old nemesis Onaga could never be revived, I have discovered that he has indeed returned from beyond death, as his holy men had prophesied. He now commands the Tarkatan Horde, a vicious fighting force once loyal 
to me. When I have killed Onaga and regained control of Outworld, they will pay for their treason with their lives!&quot;<hr class="sub">

drawing near. Their actions would determine the fate of these superior kombatants and ultimately prevent Armageddon. It seems, however, that one brother has been prematurely revived.<br>
During my quest, I was overpowered by holy men who served Onaga. For ages I was bound to the growing strength of Ki Chao warriors. Finally free, I have emerged to discover beings whose power and numbers exceed that which the realms can sustain. I have sounded 
the call. The sleeping brother will soon awaken.&quot;<hr class="sub">

by frozen corpses. I must still be in Outworld. The Medallion is gone. No doubt Sub-Zero took it from me and left me here to die. He will pay dearly.<br>
I have made my way back to Earthrealm and have returned to the Lin Kuei temple to defeat Sub-Zero. No one here has suspected my presence. I wait in hiding, listening to their chatter for some due to his whereabouts. He is still in Outworld, they say. There 
are murmurs of a new enemy growing strength in that realm. I only hope that Sub-Zero survives this new threat. He will pay dearly upon his return.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;In The Deadly Alliance, I pursued ultimate power with ruthless ambition. My alliance with Tsung was strategic, aiming to revive Onaga's invincible army. Yet, betrayal lurked as Tsung coveted Shinnok's amulet. My foresight kept the true artifact and preserved 
my supremacy, even as our partnership faltered.<br>
<br>
When Raiden's cataclysmic blast threatened all, Shinnok's portal whisked me to safety, securing my survival. As the realms teeter on the brink, I am poised to reclaim my destiny. With Shinnok's support and the amulet in hand, I will rise from the ruins and 
fulfill my dark ambitions.&quot;<hr class="sub">

&quot;I was born into Edenian royalty, but my life took a dark turn when Shao Kahn's forces ravaged my homeland. Initially, I betrayed my people to save myself from Kahn's wrath, aligning with him out of fear. However, my true heritage and my father's death

<br>
My loyalty wavers as I wrestle with my conflicted past. Though I fought fiercely for Kahn, the revelation of my father's fate and Kitana's pleas for my redemption haunt me. Now, in the midst of this chaos, I struggle to reconcile my actions with the good that 
still lingers within me, questioning where my true allegiance lies.&quot;<hr class="sub">

During this time, I continue to play a crucial role in Kahn's schemes, though I harbor a deep-seated disdain for Quan Chi. My focus remains on solidifying my power and undermining potential rivals, all while navigating the treacherous politics of our dark

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
&quot;After my return to Outworld and sanctuary with the Lin Kuei, my loyalty to Sub-Zero grew stronger each day. My feelings for him, though new and confusing, felt profoundly different from the mindless obedience I once had under Quan Chi's control. This 
uncharted emotion seemed to offer hope and purpose beyond the dark influence of my Netherrealm past.<br>
<br>
Yet, the shadow of my demon nature loomed large, threatening to unravel my newfound sense of belonging. Dark forces sought to manipulate me, drawing me back into the depths of evil. My struggle to understand and embrace my feelings for Sub-Zero became a battle 
against my own inner demons, making every moment a test of my commitment to both him and the Lin Kuei.&quot;<hr class="sub">

With Quan Chi's return and Shinnok's dark plans unfolding, I see my chance to escape Kahn's control. For now, I feign loyalty while plotting my rise. My patience will pay off, and when the moment comes, I'll claim the power I need to finally secure my freedom.&quot;<hr class="sub">

I inch closer to my supreme return.<br>

Every action I take is controlled by Noob's dark programming, a relentless reminder of my lost humanity. My thoughts and desires are buried beneath layers of metal and circuitry. I watch in anguish as I am used for evil, while my true self remains imprisoned,
