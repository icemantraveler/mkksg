   me worthy to study with his Shaolin masters. After a lifetime of wishing for 
   one, I finally had a home. But my joy was tempered as I thought about Sareena... 
   My Shadow Sister was still under Quan Chi's yoke. And she deserved a life free 
   of him as much, if not more, than I. Quan Chi and my other sisters proved 
   tenacious, but they were no match for my blade. I snatched Sareena from them. 
   Then Liu Kang helped me break Quan Chi's spell. Her mind free of his influence 
   for the first time in years, Sareena chose to join me in Earthrealm. My sister

   in silence, ignored by the rest of Outworld. Though now I knew Empress Mileena's 
   secret: that she was also afflicted with Tarkat. If anyone would help, it would 
   be her. But how to get an audience? Syzoth. He was the Empress's new emissary to 
   the Zaterrans. I asked him to introduce us. At great personal risk, he agreed. 
   And as I'd prayed, the Empress was willing to meet. Even better, she would visit 
   the colony. She was shocked to see how we lived. She moved quickly to provide 
   for our care and comfort. Thanks to the Empress and Syzoth, we Tarkatans are no

   would hold me is laughable. Once free, I began planning my next campaign. I 
   would need an unstoppable army to overthrow Mileena. Unfortunately, most of 
   my former soldiers lacked the courage to rally to my standard. Rebuilding my 
   army would require finding new recruits. And that task…is proving easier than 
   expected. Outworld's "Golden Age" has left more than a few behind. Without

   question that they could again be broken. Protecting this timeline would require 
   eternal vigilance, so that it could not fall victim to further outside 
   aggression. But nothing in my countless lifetimes had prepared me for this task. 
   In none of them had multiple timelines ever coexisted. Monitoring them for 
   threats was an entirely novel problem. It would require a novel solution. I 
   discovered that, though the timelines no longer touched, their meeting had left 
   them intertwined. I can now secretly surveil all timelines, keeping watch for 
   potential danger. It pleases me to do this service for the new era. Lord Liu

   when Rain approached me. On the run from Empress Mileena, he was desperate for 
   help. And though I'd had my fill of sorcerers, this one was different. I agreed 
   to provide him safe haven. He agreed to help topple Seido's government. And 
   topple it we did. Rain summoned a wave so vast, so powerful, that it crushed the 
   capital. Seido's fascist ruler were swept away. My people are finally free. They

   be his champion. I mean, sure, I was killin' it as a martial arts star. But it's 
   one thing when it's all for show. It's different when you're playin' for keeps. 
   Then Liu Kang let me in on his master plan. He wanted the masses to know about 
   the world beyond them, the one filled with gods and monsters. And he wanted me 
   to tell 'em about it. But I knew revealing the truth all at once would be too 
   shocking of a plot twist for most. That's why I pitched doing a bunch of 
   stories, to slowly get people used to it. And if there's one thing I can do, 
   besides kick ass in kombat, it's build a cinematic universe. I'm servin' up 
   movies, streaming series, games, you name it. I like that I'm doing a public

   wiretap and came calling, hoping I'd be his informant. We planned to part ways 
   when we got the job done. but then Shang Tsung showed up to steal Sento. 
   (chuckles) Needless to say, Jackson had questions. It blew his mind to hear the 
   stories in Johnny's movies were real. Once the shock wore off, Jackson quickly 
   sized up the threats Earthrealm faced. To deal with them, he got his bosses at 
   the FBI to form the Outworld Investigation Agency. When he asked me to sign on,

   "General Shao’s revolt left Outworld’s armies in tatters. We were 
   vulnerable to enemies both foreign and domestic. That’s why my sister asked me 
   to take command. To stitch her military back together and purge Shao’s loyalists 
   within it. She trusted only me with the task. The soldiers, however, had little 
   faith. They thought me a spoiled dilettante, unprepared and unfit to serve. That 
   I could fight mattered little. All that mattered was that I wasn’t one of them. 
   I finally earned their loyalty by orchestrating an epic victory over Shao and 
   his rebels. Though the general himself escaped, his forces were smashed. For as

   "It was inevitable that the Shaolin masters had me join them. They knew 
   just how much future initiates could learn from me. Shujinko was one of my 
   earliest. His ability to absorb anyone's powers and skills was amazing. With 
   the right training, he could become our greatest champion. I knew that I 
   alone could give it to him. But as his proficiency grew, so did his ego. In 
   love with himself and his power, Shujinko became a threat to the realms. He 
   hadn't learned humility, because I wasn't the one who could teach it. I 
   should have listened to Raiden's warning and not tried to train Shujinko 
   alone. After he was subdued, Shujinko's accumulated abilities and memories 
   were taken from him. He is once again a new initiate, ready to begin his 
   training. This time, Raiden and I train Shujinko together. He will become the

   lead her Imperial Police. Thought I missed Empress Sindel dearly, I was glad 
   my ties with her family had been mended. But while it was an honor to be made 
   responsible for Outworld's internal security, I soon realized accepting the 
   appointment was a mistake. I'm not cut out to be a bureaucrat, nor am I 
   patient enough to navigate the imperial court's politics. I was at my best 
   patrolling Sun Do's streets. When I could feel the city's pulse, and serve and

   back my power had cost me my immortality. While my life span would still stretch 
   across eons, I would one day perish. And if the war with Titan Shang Tsung 
   taught me anything, it is that this timeline is not safe without a protector. 
   Yet I had never given thought to choosing a successor. Who is it that could 
   replace me and protect my New Era? The answer, of course, is Geras. Tireless and

   one of my mother’s few mistakes. Like all Outworlders, she treated Tarkatans 
   with scorn. What they deserved from us was compassion. And the only way to get

   realms to feed my people. I simply needed to capture enough beings to breed 
   them. Once they multiply, Vaeternus will have a limitless, renewable source 
   of food. And I only need a few thousand to start. A number so small, compared

   replace him in this new era? Why was I made mortal? Lord Liu Kang told me of his 
   Raiden's nobility and righteousness. About his steadfast leadership in the 
   defense of Earthrealm. He also told me about Raiden's dark side. How he could be 
   consumed by rage and cast aside the rules he otherwise lived by. Making me 
   mortal and incapable of such anger was to keep me from following in his 
   footsteps. Though I understood the reasons why, I felt I had been done a 
   disservice. To survive the coming battles, I may need the edge that only great 
   rage can bring. As the Shaolin couldn't aid me, I sought someone who could. 
   Someone to stoke the fire within me... and teach me to master it. For this, I

   Though he couldn't save my body, Jerrod has preserved my soul. Like him and 
   countless others, I am now a part of Ermac. Yet ours is not a peaceful 
   repose. The collected souls within Ermac have their own needs and agendas. 
   Before we can speak as one, we must first reach consensus. I had thought, as 
   the former rulers of Outworld, I and Jerrod would hold sway. But here we are, 
   two souls among many thousands, fighting for the right to be heard. And if 
   there is one thing we do well together, it is fight. We will win the right to 
   govern Ermac as we once had governed Outworld. And we will rule for the 
   benefit of all."<hr color="#333333">

   "Kuai Liang and I were working hard to build our new clan. But even 
   with the help of his close friend, Harumi, it was difficult. The biggest 
   problem was finding the initiates. Then, one night, while walking outside 
   Harumi's compound, I was attacked. I thought at first it was a Lin Kuei 
   assassin. But his strikes were uncertain, too angry. My attacker, it turns 
   out, was a boy. Homeless and hungry, his assault was born of desperation. He 
   needed money so that he could eat. It was looking at myself, fifteen years 
   ago. I would've ended up just like him, if the Lin Kuei hadn't taken me in. 
   So I took the boy to Kuai Liang, who also appreciated his fire. We made him 
   our first initiate. The boy's name? Hanzo Hasashi."<hr color="#333333">

   "I had broken the Lin Kuei free of Liu Kang's enslavement. We were now 
   masters of our destiny and could take our place among Earthrealm's greatest 
   nations. But taking and holding territory would require a vast army. I needed 
   more fighters to make our presence felt. Then I recalled Shang Tsung's dragon 
   warriors. An army of them would be unstoppable. But trafficking in such strong 
   magic would surely draw Liu Kang's attention. Sektor advised me that we avoid 
   detection by building our army using science, not sorcery. We've invested much 
   time in this endeavor, and we are beginning to see results. Once again proving 
   the depths of Sektor's genius. When we are done, all of Earthrealm will honor 
   our desires and heed our demands. If not, they will face the Lin Kuei's wrath."<hr color="#333333">

   "Until recently, I hadn’t met Li Mei, but I had heard the stories. How the 
   Umgadi’s Matrons Superior blamed her not for preventing Jerrod’s murder. How she 
   quit in disgrace rather than accept punishment. But those stories didn’t fit the 
   women I now knew. Li Mei would never have been so negligent. Eventually, I 
   uncovered the truth, the failures and mistakes which led to the emperor’s 
   murder. They resulted from poor decisions made by the Matron Superiors 
   themselves. They made Li Mei their scapegoat. When the Empress found out, she 
   wanted the Umgadi disbanded. But I convinced her that it could be reformed. To 
   make sure it did, she put me in charge. I am humbled by this scared 
   responsibility. The Umgadi, my sisters, they are my life. I will not let them be 
   brought down by the acts of a selfish few."<hr color="#333333">

   "After escaping Lei Chin prison, I was hounded by the Imperial Police. 
   I needed a place to hide and to recuperate, while I plotted the best way 
   forward. I knew the remote canton of my youth would be perfect. To escape 
   capture, I travelled by sea. Little did I know that a gargantuan storm was 
   brewing. My tiny craft was smashed apart. I closed my eyes, waiting to drown, 
   hoping that the Netherrealm wouldn't claim my soul. But when I reopened them, 
   I found myself not in Hell, but on a deserted island. From its ruins I could 
   tell that great sorcerers had once lived there. In the caves beneath the 
   ruins, I found what I can only describe as a Well of Souls. Once I learn how 
   to wield its power, I will become invincible."<hr color="#333333">
