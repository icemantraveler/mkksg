<img alt="Intro 1" border="0" class="logo" height="254" src="intro1.jpg" title="Intro 1" width="152"><br>
&quot;You have been chosen to represent Earth in Mortal Kombat. Be warned.<br>
Although your souls are protected against Shao Kahn's evil; your lives are not.<br>
I cannot interfere any longer as your world is now ruled by the Outworld gods.&quot;<br>
<br>
These are the words of Raiden<br>
<br>
<img alt="Intro 2" border="0" class="logo" height="128" src="intro2.jpg" title="Intro 2" width="400"><br>
For centuries, Earth has used Mortal Kombat to defend itself against the Outworld's Emperor Shao Kahn.<br>

<br>
<img alt="Intro 3" border="0" class="logo" height="128" src="intro3.jpg" title="Intro 3" width="400"><br>
During this time, Kahn had a queen. Her name was Sindel and her young death was unexpected.<br>
Kahn's shadow priests, lead by Shang Tsung, make it so Sindel's spirit would someday be reborn;<br>
not on the Outworld, but on the Earth realm itself.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Intro 4" border="0" class="logo" height="128" src="intro4.jpg" title="Intro 4" width="400"><br>

Thus, enabling him to finally seize the Earth realm.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Intro 5" border="0" class="logo" height="128" src="intro5.jpg" title="Intro 5" width="400"><br>

<br>
<img alt="Intro 6" border="0" class="logo" height="128" src="intro6.jpg" title="Intro 6" width="400"><br>
He then strips the Earth of all human life, claiming every soul as his own.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Intro 7" border="0" class="logo" height="128" src="intro7.jpg" title="Intro 7" width="400"><br>
But, there are souls which Kahn cannot take.<br>
These souls belong to the warriors chosen to represent Earth in a new Mortal Kombat.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Intro 8" border="0" class="logo" height="128" src="intro8.jpg" title="Intro 8" width="400"><br>
The remaining humans are scattered throughout the planet.<br>
