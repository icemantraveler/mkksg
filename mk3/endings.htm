Cyrax is captured by Sub-Zero and reprogrammed with new orders: Destroy Shao Kahn. With Kahn unable to detect the assassin's soulless presence, Cyrax delivers a successful sneak attack.<br>
<br>
But, after eliminating Kahn and saving Earth, Cyrax awaits new orders from his Lin Kuei headquarters. The orders never come and Cyrax malfunctions. He ends up stranded in the middle of a vast desert, blindly heading toward his base.<hr class="main">

The second time Jax battles the forces of Shao Kahn he comes prepared. Thought to be the strongest man on Earth, he has no problem proving it: First by beating Kahn's armies then by defeating the Emperor himself.<br>
<br>
When the world reverts back to normal, Jax and Sonya start the Outer World Investigation Agency. Jax runs the exploratory division which learns to open portals through science rather than magic. He leads the first expedition into a mysterious new realm.<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="KABAL"><img alt="Kabal" border="1" height="75" src="../mkt/bio_kabal.jpg" title="Kabal" width="61"></a> <b>Kabal</b><hr class="sub">

After returning from near death, Kabal swears revenge against his attackers. He fights alongside the other Earth warriors. When he defeats Motaro and the mighty Shao Kahn, he proves that he truly is the chosen one.<br>
<br>
Before the invasion, Kabal lived a life of crime. He was once a member of the Black Dragon along with Kano. Now Kabal devotes his life to fighting injustice. He will give crime's inner circles a new reason to fear.<hr class="main">

When Shao Kahn lets Kano live, he fails to realize the resourcefulness of the scheming human. Kano lures Kahn's army away on a false mission, then nukes them using a stolen weapon. He fights the remaining warriors and finally defeats Kahn himself.<br>
<br>
Kano's true intention is to take over the souls which Kahn once possessed. But Kano is unable to control the spirits as they escape and attack him. Rumored to have suffered a violent death, Kano was ignorant of the fact that he saved the world he tried to 
conquer.<hr class="main">

When Shao Kahn invades Earth, Kung Lao must scrap his plans of reuniting the White Lotus Society. He instead must focus on the new tournament. He seeks Liu Kang and together they battle Kahn's forces fearlessly.<br>
<br>
Using the knowledge he obtained as a Shaolin monk, he fights in the name of his great ancestor - the original Kung Lao. He emerges victorious but suffers from injuries during battle with Kahn. Believed to have passed away, Kung Lao joins his ancestor in a 
new life.<hr class="main">

After thwarting Shao Kahn in the past, Liu Kang finds himself the main target of Kahn's extermination squads. But Kang is the reigning Mortal Kombat champion and proves it by easily defeating Kahn's minions.<br>
<br>
But it's the apparent death of his friend Kung Lao that enrages Kang and enables him to find the strength to defeat Shao Kahn. Then, before the portal closes, Liu Kang is greeted by Princess Kitana and thanked for saving the Earth and the Outworld.<hr class="main">

After eventually terminating Sub-Zero, Sektor is attacked by Shao Kahn's army. Unfamiliar with the Outworld warriors, Sektor fights back. He targets Kahn and all Outworld beings as threats to the Lin Kuei.<br>
<br>
Kahn's minions are no match for Sektor, who fights his way into the fortress. Once inside, Sektor initiates his self-destruct sequence. The resulting explosion is so massive that it closes the portal and returns Earth back to normal.<hr class="main">

When Shao Kahn overtakes the Earth, he needs Shang Tsung to help locate the surviving humans. Granted new powers, Tsung soon discovers his dark emperor's true plan: as soon as the remaining warriors are disposed of, Kahn will take Tsung's own soul.<br>
<br>
After learning of this, Tsung turns on his master. He catches Motaro off guard and then defeats Shao Kahn. But before the Earth can return to normal, Tsung takes all the souls as his own. He will forever rule Earth with his own brand of evil.<hr class="main">

While Sheeva serves her master on Earth, her race of Shokan are being punished on the Outworld. Kahn now favors Motaro's race of centaurs and aids them in defeating the Shokan. After learning of these events, Sheeva turns on her master.<br>
<br>
She defeats Motaro and in a rage brings down Kahn. In freeing the Earth, she also frees the Outworld. She then returns home and works to restore the pride and respect of her race.<hr class="main">

Sindel receives visions of her true past and turns against Shao Kahn. She discovers that her true king was named Jerrod. They once had a daughter named Kitana and ruled a realm called Edenia, before Kahn took it away in their own Mortal Kombat.<br>
<br>
He used Sindel as a pawn in his quest for Earth and took Kitana as his own daughter. But in defeating Shao Kahn Sindel frees the Earth. In doing so, she also liberates Edenia and insures a reunion with her 10,000-year-old daughter - Kitana.<hr class="main">
