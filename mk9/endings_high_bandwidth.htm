<a href="#top" name="Baraka">
<img alt="Baraka" border="1" height="75" src="bio_baraka.jpg" title="Baraka" width="75"></a>
<b>Baraka</b><hr class="sub">

Shokan and Centaur alike were enraged that Baraka, Shao Kahn's trusted enforcer, 
had turned on their master and killed him just as Earthrealm was within their grasp.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/baraka1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
But their anger turned to admiration as the lifeless body of Shao Kahn transformed 
into that of the treacherous sorcerer Shang Tsung.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/baraka2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Shang had attempted to claim the realm for himself by posing as Shao Kahn. The deception 
had not fooled Baraka. He had recognized Shang Tsung's scent and torn out his throat.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/baraka3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
With Earthrealm finally in Shao Kahn's control, Baraka's loyalty and bold action 
were rewarded.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/baraka4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
Tarkatans replaced the Centaur as the emperor's Favored Race. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Cyrax">
<img alt="Cyrax" border="1" height="75" src="bio_cyrax.jpg" title="Cyrax" width="75"></a>
<b>Cyrax</b><hr class="sub">

Though he had pledged his life to the Lin Kuei, Cyrax left the clan to help the 
Earthrealm heroes turn back Shao Kahn's invasion.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/cyrax1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
For this act of desertion, he was marked for termination by the new Grand Master--Sektor. 
Surrounded and severely outnumbered, Cyrax prepared to meet his fate when Raiden 
came to his aid.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/cyrax2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
With him were 100 Shaolin monks. The Lin Kuei were defeated, though Sektor was not 
counted among the dead.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/cyrax3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Cyrax was offered sanctuary at the Wu Shi Academy, where he has begun a new life 
as an honorable warrior for peace. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Ermac">
<img alt="Ermac" border="1" height="75" src="bio_ermac.jpg" title="Ermac" width="75"></a>
<b>Ermac</b><hr class="sub">

With Shao Kahn dead, Ermac was no longer bound to him.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/ermac1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
Anarchy erupted within Ermac as the many warrior souls that comprised his being 
struggled for dominance.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/ermac2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Only one had the strength of will to quiet the chaos. The conflict resolved, Ermac 
returned to Outworld, determined to reunite with his past.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/ermac3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Queen Sindel and Princess Kitana were shocked to learn the truth: that trapped among 
the many spirits within Ermac was their husband and father, King Jerrod.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/ermac4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
Though he would never be the Jerrod they once knew, Ermac would forever serve and 
protect his queen and the Edenian people. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Jade">
<img alt="Jade" border="1" height="75" src="bio_jade.jpg" title="Jade" width="75"></a>
<b>Jade</b><hr class="sub">

Shao Kahn was defeated, but the intense battle rendered Jade unconscious.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jade1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
She slipped into a dream-like state and found herself walking in an unknown realm.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jade2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
As she explored, her surroundings shifted and changed.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jade3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Jade approached a lone figure who stood in the distance--a shimmering woman. She 
did not reveal her name, but spoke with an air of regal authority. Through the minds 
of countless mortals, the woman had been watching events as they unfolded over the 
centuries.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jade4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
She informed Jade that Shao Kahn's death was an outcome that must be re-imagined.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image5" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jade5.png" title="Ending Image 5" width="638"><br>
Jade was defenseless as the woman possessed her body and emerged in the waking world.
<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Jax">
<img alt="Jax" border="1" height="75" src="bio_jax.jpg" title="Jax" width="75"></a>
<b>Jax</b><hr class="sub">

After the invasion was thwarted, many of Jax's allies had seemingly disappeared, 
leaving him to clean up the mess on his own.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jax1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
He searched for Shao Kahn's remaining forces utilizing a new cyber-scanner designed 
to remotely access worldwide databases.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jax2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Navigating its virtual reality interface, Jax inadvertently accessed Kano's brain 
through his optical laser implant.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jax3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Their minds linked, Jax virtually battled Kano.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jax4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
Finally he captured and quarantined Kano's consciousness within the Special Forces 
mainframe.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image5" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/jax5.png" title="Ending Image 5" width="638"><br>
A dangerous criminal had finally been neutralized. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Johnny Cage">
<img alt="Johnny Cage" border="1" height="75" src="bio_johnny_cage.jpg" title="Johnny Cage" width="75"></a>
<b>Johnny Cage</b><hr class="sub">

As the last remnants of Shao Kahn disintegrated, Johnny felt strange, as if he had 
lost control of his body.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/johnnycage1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/johnnycage2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Suddenly, powerful energy burst forth, destroying everything around him.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/johnnycage3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Johnny sought the aid of Raiden and Nightwolf, but their efforts did nothing to 
stop these random spasms of destruction.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/johnnycage4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
Desperate, Raiden transported Johnny to Seido, the Realm of Order, where he could 
be taught to control his power. Johnny Cage will transform into a warrior powerful 
beyond mortal imagining. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Kabal">
<img alt="Kabal" border="1" height="75" src="bio_kabal.jpg" title="Kabal" width="75"></a>
<b>Kabal</b><hr class="sub">

Victory over Shao Kahn came with a heavy price. Kabal's respirator was badly damaged 
and if it was not repaired soon, he would surely die.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kabal1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
Desperate, he tracked down Kano and forced from him the identity of the cyberneticist 
who developed Kano's eye laser.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kabal2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
The good doctor was not easy to find, but he was more than eager to help-for a price.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kabal3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Now Kabal is rebuilt. He is better than he was before. Stronger. Faster. He will 
need to be in order to repay his debt. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Kano">
<img alt="Kano" border="1" height="75" src="bio_kano.jpg" title="Kano" width="75"></a>
<b>Kano</b><hr class="sub">

Kano made a fortune selling arms to Shao Kahn and used the profits to upgrade his 
cybernetics.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kano1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
The added connectivity of his eye implant gave him unparalleled access to global 
communications. Using his mind, he navigated the databases of banks, law enforcement 
agencies and other networks. But his activities left him vulnerable to hackers.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kano2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Jax infiltrated Kano's mind and trapped his consciousness in the Special Forces 
mainframe. It wasn't long, however, until Kano managed to free himself.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kano3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
His consciousness spread like a virus throughout the Special Forces network of automated 
weaponry.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kano4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
Kano has become a one-man army. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Kitana">
<img alt="Kitana" border="1" height="75" src="bio_kitana.jpg" title="Kitana" width="75"></a>
<b>Kitana</b><hr class="sub">

Kitana had ended Shao Kahn's life for his betrayal. She had discovered the truth 
about Mileena...<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kitana1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
... but rather than slay her as well, she took pity on her half-sister. She offered 
Mileena a home within the Edenian aristocracy. She was, after all, of royal blood. 
Mileena cautiously accepted her sister's invitation.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kitana2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
With Mileena and Jade at her side, Kitana formed a fighting force dedicated to bringing 
justice to the realms.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kitana3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Never again would a warlord arise to create such terror. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Kung Lao">
<img alt="Kung Lao" border="1" height="75" src="bio_kung_lao.jpg" title="Kung Lao" width="75"></a>
<b>Kung Lao</b><hr class="sub">

Kung Lao had avenged his ancestor's death and saved Earthrealm from Shao Kahn's 
brutality.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kunglao1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
In quiet reflection with Raiden at the grave of the Great Kung Lao, he touched the 
modest stone marker.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kunglao2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Images of past events, moments of someone else's life, flashed through his mind,<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kunglao3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
concluding with a lost battle against Goro.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kunglao4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
Raiden theorized that Kung Lao had unlocked memories of his past life.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image5" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kunglao5.png" title="Ending Image 5" width="638"><br>
The Kung Lao that stood before Raiden was in fact the reincarnation of the Great 
Kung Lao, who had been defeated by Goro 500 years ago.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image6" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/kunglao6.png" title="Ending Image 6" width="638"><br>
He had accomplished in the present what he could not in the past.
<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Liu Kang">
<img alt="Liu Kang" border="1" height="75" src="bio_liu_kang.jpg" title="Liu Kang" width="75"></a>
<b>Liu Kang</b><hr class="sub">

Having defeated Shao Kahn, Liu Kang believed he was the only one capable of defending 
Earthrealm against outside threats.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/liukang1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
During the invasion Raiden had been more burden than ally. Brazenly he demanded 
the Elder Gods grant him the thunder god's status.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/liukang2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
In a one-match Mortal Kombat tournament, Liu Kang defeated his former friend and 
mentor.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/liukang3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Liu Kang's request was granted. He was made a god-the new Protector of Earthrealm.
<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Mileena">
<img alt="Mileena" border="1" height="75" src="bio_mileena.jpg" title="Mileena" width="75"></a>
<b>Mileena</b><hr class="sub">

Mileena killed the emperor in a fit of deranged fury. But she was unaware that her 
victory resulted from Shang Tsung's designs.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/mileena1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
He had imbued Mileena with the ability to drain Shao Kahn's dark magic, rendering 
him vulnerable.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/mileena2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Now Shang Tsung was ready to execute the next phase of his plan: murder Mileena 
and take Shao Kahn's power for himself.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/mileena3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
But Mileena instinctively wielded her new dark power against the sorcerer. Shang 
Tsung's end came quickly. Mileena absorbed his soul, multiplying her strength. She 
then set out to claim an even bigger prize: the soul of a thunder god.
<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Nightwolf">
<img alt="Nightwolf" border="1" height="75" src="bio_nightwolf.jpg" title="Nightwolf" width="75"></a>
<b>Nightwolf</b><hr class="sub">

It took all of Nightwolf's power to destroy Shao Kahn. His spirit guide, the wolf, 
had aided him in the battle, but in the aftermath its presence was no longer felt.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/nightwolf1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
Nightwolf returned to his home, seeking the elders' help in reconnecting to the 
spirit world.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/nightwolf2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
During their ritual, his wolf returned to him--changed. Shao Kahn had tethered his 
soul to the wolf spirit in order to cheat death.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/nightwolf3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Now corrupted with Shao Kahn's evil, Nightwolf has transformed into his Animality, 
his bite converting his victims into subservient lycanthropes.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/nightwolf4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>
Through Nightwolf, Shao Kahn will conquer Earthrealm one mortal at a time.
<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Noob Saibot">
<img alt="Noob Saibot" border="1" height="75" src="bio_noob_saibot.jpg" title="Noob Saibot" width="75"></a>
<b>Noob Saibot</b><hr class="sub">

Quan Chi should never have resurrected Noob Saibot. Nor should he have enhanced 
his power to defeat Shao Kahn.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/noob1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
The revenant he created had broken free of his control. Noob had secretly formed 
an &quot;understanding&quot; with a cleric from the realm of Chaos and opened for 
him a portal to the Netherrealm.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/noob2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Shinnok, Quan Chi and the Brotherhood of Shadow were unprepared as the forces of 
Chaos overwhelmed them, leaving the Underworld severely weakened. Satisfied with 
his work, the cleric, Havik, returned to the realm of Chaos.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/noob3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Noob Saibot remained to seize control of the Netherrealm. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Raiden">
<img alt="Raiden" border="1" height="75" src="bio_raiden.jpg" title="Raiden" width="75"></a>
<b>Raiden</b><hr class="sub">

Shao Kahn was gone, but the scars of the merging of realms remained.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/raiden1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
Remnants of the invasion force roamed freely and had to be dealt with. But Earthrealm 
is vast and Raiden is but one being.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/raiden2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
He recruited four warriors, one for each direction of the wind, and divided his 
soul, placing one part in each of them.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/raiden3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Through these new heroes Raiden can kombat the forces of darkness in four places 
at once. <hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="Reptile">
<img alt="Reptile" border="1" height="75" src="bio_reptile.jpg" title="Reptile" width="75"></a>
<b>Reptile</b><hr class="sub">

Having defeated Shao Kahn, Reptile was feared by all. He forced Shang Tsung to regenerate 
his Raptor race.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/reptile1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
The process took agonizing months, but soon Reptile heard the snarls of young broodlings 
throughout the Flesh Pits. Eventually, Shang Tsung had created an army of Raptor 
warriors bred to serve Reptile.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/reptile2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
They stormed the realm, killing any Tarkatan, Shokan or Centaur who opposed Reptile's 
rule. The intoxicating feeling of reuniting with his people blinded Reptile to the 
suffering of his former comrades.<br>

Shao Kahn's death did nothing to relieve Scorpion's pain. The loss of his kin still 
weighed heavily upon him.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/scorpion1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
For reasons he could neither explain nor understand, he was drawn to the home of 
the Shirai Ryu. Standing amid the rubble in solemn contemplation,<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/scorpion2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Scorpion was visited by apparitions of his fallen comrades, who revealed the true 
mastermind behind their brutal deaths.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/scorpion3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>

<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sektor1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
It was time to replace his father. In a bold attack, Sektor smashed through a company 
of cyber Lin Kuei guards as he pushed toward the Grand Master's chamber.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sektor2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
There he found his father waiting. The Grand Master warned him that wearing the 
Dragon Medallion brought much power, but at a cost.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sektor3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>
Sektor ignored the warning and slew his father, whose soul burst from his body and 
flew into the medallion. Sektor placed the artifact around his neck.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image4" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sektor4.png" title="Ending Image 4" width="638"><br>

<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/shang1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
Overwhelmed by his newfound sorcery, he fled to Outworld. Moments before suicide, 
Shang Tsung was visited by Bo' Rai Cho. The mentor of warriors offered to teach 
him to control the dark magic, but for a special purpose:<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/shang2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
Liu Kang had become a god. The power had corrupted him, transforming him into a 
tyrant. He needed to be stopped.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image3" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/shang3.png" title="Ending Image 3" width="638"><br>

Sheeva had recognized the signs. Her people were out of favor and in decline. The 
Centaur would soon dominate Shao Kahn's forces while the Shokan would move inexorably 
toward extinction.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sheeva1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>
Sheeva's act of defiance, her murder of Shao Kahn, made possible a new home for 
her people among the mortals of Earthrealm--a world free of both Tarkatan and Centaur.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sheeva2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
With cooperation from world leaders, Sheeva secured for the Shokan the continent

The spell that bewitched Queen Sindel had been broken. She did battle with Shao

of others throughout the realms.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image1" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sindel1.png" title="Ending Image 1" width="638"><br>

realm to its former glory.<br>
<img alt="Ending Image2" border="1" class="logo" height="255" src="endings/sindel2.png" title="Ending Image 2" width="638"><br>
The many races of Outworld were impressed. Not only had Sindel defeated Shao Kahn,

their allegiance. Under Sindel's governance, the realms of Edenia and Outworld remain 
merged in spirit. <hr class="main">
