<img src="bio_baraka.jpg" title="Baraka" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Baraka"></a> <b>
Baraka</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Shokan and Centaur alike were enraged that Baraka, Shao Kahn's trusted enforcer, 
had turned on their master and killed him just as Earthrealm was within their 
grasp.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/baraka1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
But their anger turned to admiration as the lifeless body of Shao Kahn 
transformed into that of the treacherous sorcerer Shang Tsung.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/baraka2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Shang had attempted to claim the realm for himself by posing as Shao Kahn. The 
deception had not fooled Baraka. He had recognized Shang Tsung's scent and torn 
out his throat.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/baraka3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
With Earthrealm finally in Shao Kahn's control, Baraka's loyalty and bold action 
were rewarded.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/baraka4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
Tarkatans replaced the Centaur as the emperor's Favored Race.
<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Cyrax">
<img src="bio_cyrax.jpg" title="Cyrax" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Cyrax"></a> <b>
Cyrax</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Though he had pledged his life to the Lin Kuei, Cyrax left the clan to help the 
Earthrealm heroes turn back Shao Kahn's invasion.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/cyrax1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
For this act of desertion, he was marked for termination by the new Grand 
Master--Sektor. Surrounded and severely outnumbered, Cyrax prepared to meet his 
fate when Raiden came to his aid.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/cyrax2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
With him were 100 Shaolin monks. The Lin Kuei were defeated, though Sektor was 
not counted among the dead.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/cyrax3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Cyrax was offered sanctuary at the Wu Shi Academy, where he has begun a new life 
as an honorable warrior for peace. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Ermac">
<img src="bio_ermac.jpg" title="Ermac" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Ermac"></a> <b>
Ermac</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
With Shao Kahn dead, Ermac was no longer bound to him.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/ermac1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
Anarchy erupted within Ermac as the many warrior souls that comprised his being 
struggled for dominance.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/ermac2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Only one had the strength of will to quiet the chaos. The conflict resolved, 
Ermac returned to Outworld, determined to reunite with his past.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/ermac3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Queen Sindel and Princess Kitana were shocked to learn the truth: that trapped 
among the many spirits within Ermac was their husband and father, King Jerrod.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/ermac4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
Though he would never be the Jerrod they once knew, Ermac would forever serve 
and protect his queen and the Edenian people. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Jade">
<img src="bio_jade.jpg" title="Jade" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Jade"></a> <b>
Jade</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Shao Kahn was defeated, but the intense battle rendered Jade unconscious.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jade1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
She slipped into a dream-like state and found herself walking in an unknown 
realm.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jade2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
As she explored, her surroundings shifted and changed.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jade3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Jade approached a lone figure who stood in the distance--a shimmering woman. She 
did not reveal her name, but spoke with an air of regal authority. Through the 
minds of countless mortals, the woman had been watching events as they unfolded 
over the centuries.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jade4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
She informed Jade that Shao Kahn's death was an outcome that must be 
re-imagined.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jade5.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 5" title="Ending Image 5"><br>
Jade was defenseless as the woman possessed her body and emerged in the waking 
world. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Jax">
<img src="bio_jax.jpg" title="Jax" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Jax"></a> <b>Jax</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
After the invasion was thwarted, many of Jax's allies had seemingly disappeared, 
leaving him to clean up the mess on his own.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jax1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
He searched for Shao Kahn's remaining forces utilizing a new cyber-scanner 
designed to remotely access worldwide databases.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jax2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Navigating its virtual reality interface, Jax inadvertently accessed Kano's 
brain through his optical laser implant.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jax3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Their minds linked, Jax virtually battled Kano.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jax4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
Finally he captured and quarantined Kano's consciousness within the Special 
Forces mainframe.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/jax5.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 5" title="Ending Image 5"><br>
A dangerous criminal had finally been neutralized. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Johnny Cage">
<img src="bio_johnny_cage.jpg" title="Johnny Cage" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Johnny Cage"></a>
<b>Johnny Cage</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
As the last remnants of Shao Kahn disintegrated, Johnny felt strange, as if he 
had lost control of his body.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/johnnycage1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
<img border="1" src="endings/johnnycage2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Suddenly, powerful energy burst forth, destroying everything around him.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/johnnycage3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Johnny sought the aid of Raiden and Nightwolf, but their efforts did nothing to 
stop these random spasms of destruction.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/johnnycage4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
Desperate, Raiden transported Johnny to Seido, the Realm of Order, where he 
could be taught to control his power. Johnny Cage will transform into a warrior 
powerful beyond mortal imagining. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Kabal">
<img src="bio_kabal.jpg" title="Kabal" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Kabal"></a> <b>
Kabal</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Victory over Shao Kahn came with a heavy price.&nbsp; Kabal's respirator was 
badly damaged and if it was not repaired soon, he would surely die.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kabal1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
Desperate, he tracked down Kano and forced from him the identity of the 
cyberneticist who developed Kano's eye laser.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kabal2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
The good doctor was not easy to find, but he was more than eager to help–for a 
price.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kabal3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Now Kabal is rebuilt. He is better than he was before. Stronger. Faster. He will 
need to be in order to repay his debt. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Kano">
<img src="bio_kano.jpg" title="Kano" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Kano"></a> <b>
Kano</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Kano made a fortune selling arms to Shao Kahn and used the profits to upgrade 
his cybernetics.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kano1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
The added connectivity of his eye implant gave him unparalleled access to global 
communications. Using his mind, he navigated the databases of banks, law 
enforcement agencies and other networks. But his activities left him vulnerable 
to hackers.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kano2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Jax infiltrated Kano's mind and trapped his consciousness in the Special Forces 
mainframe. It wasn't long, however, until Kano managed to free himself.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kano3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
His consciousness spread like a virus throughout the Special Forces network of 
automated weaponry.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kano4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
Kano has become a one-man army. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="Kitana" href="#top">
<img alt="Kitana" title="Kitana" src="bio_kitana.jpg" border="1" width="75" height="75"></a> <b>
Kitana</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Kitana had ended Shao Kahn's life for his betrayal. She had discovered the truth 
about Mileena...<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kitana1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
... but rather than slay her as well, she took pity on her half-sister. She 
offered Mileena a home within the Edenian aristocracy. She was, after all, of 
royal blood. Mileena cautiously accepted her sister's invitation.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kitana2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
With Mileena and Jade at her side, Kitana formed a fighting force dedicated to 
bringing justice to the realms.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kitana3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Never again would a warlord arise to create such terror. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Kung Lao">
<img src="bio_kung_lao.jpg" title="Kung Lao" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Kung Lao"></a>
<b>Kung Lao</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Kung Lao had avenged his ancestor's death and saved Earthrealm from Shao Kahn's 
brutality.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kunglao1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
In quiet reflection with Raiden at the grave of the Great Kung Lao, he touched 
the modest stone marker.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kunglao2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Images of past events, moments of someone else's life, flashed through his mind,<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kunglao3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
concluding with a lost battle against Goro.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kunglao4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
Raiden theorized that Kung Lao had unlocked memories of his past life.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kunglao5.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 5" title="Ending Image 5"><br>
The Kung Lao that stood before Raiden was in fact the reincarnation of the Great 
Kung Lao, who had been defeated by Goro 500 years ago.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/kunglao6.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 6" title="Ending Image 6"><br>
He had accomplished in the present what he could not in the past.
<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Liu Kang">
<img src="bio_liu_kang.jpg" title="Liu Kang" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Liu Kang"></a>
<b>Liu Kang</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Having defeated Shao Kahn, Liu Kang believed he was the only one capable of 
defending Earthrealm against outside threats.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/liukang1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
During the invasion Raiden had been more burden than ally. Brazenly he demanded 
the Elder Gods grant him the thunder god's status.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/liukang2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
In a one-match Mortal Kombat tournament, Liu Kang defeated his former friend and 
mentor.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/liukang3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Liu Kang's request was granted. He was made a god–the new Protector of 
Earthrealm. <hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Mileena">
<img src="bio_mileena.jpg" title="Mileena" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Mileena"></a>
<b>Mileena</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Mileena killed the emperor in a fit of deranged fury. But she was unaware that 
her victory resulted from Shang Tsung's designs.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/mileena1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
He had imbued Mileena with the ability to drain Shao Kahn's dark magic, 
rendering him vulnerable.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/mileena2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Now Shang Tsung was ready to execute the next phase of his plan: murder Mileena 
and take Shao Kahn's power for himself.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/mileena3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
But Mileena instinctively wielded her new dark power against the sorcerer. Shang 
Tsung's end came quickly. Mileena absorbed his soul, multiplying her strength. 
She then set out to claim an even bigger prize: the soul of a thunder god.
<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Nightwolf">
<img src="bio_nightwolf.jpg" title="Nightwolf" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Nightwolf"></a>
<b>Nightwolf</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
It took all of Nightwolf's power to destroy Shao Kahn. His spirit guide, the 
wolf, had aided him in the battle, but in the aftermath its presence was no 
longer felt.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/nightwolf1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
Nightwolf returned to his home, seeking the elders' help in reconnecting to the 
spirit world.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/nightwolf2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
During their ritual, his wolf returned to him--changed. Shao Kahn had tethered 
his soul to the wolf spirit in order to cheat death.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/nightwolf3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Now corrupted with Shao Kahn's evil, Nightwolf has transformed into his 
Animality, his bite converting his victims into subservient lycanthropes.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/nightwolf4.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 4" title="Ending Image 4"><br>
Through Nightwolf, Shao Kahn will conquer Earthrealm one mortal at a time.
<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="Noob Saibot">

<b>Noob Saibot</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Quan Chi should never have resurrected Noob Saibot. Nor should he have enhanced 
his power to defeat Shao Kahn.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/noob1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
The revenant he created had broken free of his control. Noob had secretly formed 
an &quot;understanding&quot; with a cleric from the realm of Chaos and opened for him a 
portal to the Netherrealm.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/noob2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Shinnok, Quan Chi and the Brotherhood of Shadow were unprepared as the forces of 
Chaos overwhelmed them, leaving the Underworld severely weakened. Satisfied with 
his work, the cleric, Havik, returned to the realm of Chaos.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/noob3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Noob Saibot remained to seize control of the Netherrealm. <hr color="#333333">

<img border="1" src="endings/raiden1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
Remnants of the invasion force roamed freely and had to be dealt with. But 
Earthrealm is vast and Raiden is but one being.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/raiden2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
He recruited four warriors, one for each direction of the wind, and divided his

Having defeated Shao Kahn, Reptile was feared by all. He forced Shang Tsung to 
regenerate his Raptor race.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/reptile1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
The process took agonizing months, but soon Reptile heard the snarls of young 
broodlings throughout the Flesh Pits. Eventually, Shang Tsung had created an 
army of Raptor warriors bred to serve Reptile.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/reptile2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
They stormed the realm, killing any Tarkatan, Shokan or Centaur who opposed 
Reptile's rule. The intoxicating feeling of reuniting with his people blinded 
Reptile to the suffering of his former comrades.<br>

Shao Kahn's death did nothing to relieve Scorpion's pain.&nbsp; The loss of his 
kin still weighed heavily upon him.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/scorpion1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
For reasons he could neither explain nor understand, he was drawn to the home of 
the Shirai Ryu. Standing amid the rubble in solemn contemplation,<br>

<img border="1" src="endings/sektor1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>
It was time to replace his father. In a bold attack, Sektor smashed through a

<img border="1" src="endings/sektor2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>

Dragon Medallion brought much power, but at a cost.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/sektor3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
Sektor ignored the warning and slew his father, whose soul burst from his body

Overwhelmed by his newfound sorcery, he fled to Outworld. Moments before 
suicide, Shang Tsung was visited by Bo' Rai Cho. The mentor of warriors offered 
to teach him to control the dark magic, but for a special purpose:<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/shang2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
Liu Kang had become a god. The power had corrupted him, transforming him into a 
tyrant. He needed to be stopped.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/shang3.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 3" title="Ending Image 3"><br>
After rigorous training, Shang Tsung mastered the one technique that could

inexorably toward extinction.<br>
<img border="1" src="endings/sheeva1.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 1" title="Ending Image 1"><br>

<img border="1" src="endings/sindel2.png" width="638" height="255" alt="Ending Image 2" title="Ending Image 2"><br>
The many races of Outworld were impressed. Not only had Sindel defeated Shao 
Kahn, but she had shown great leadership in chaotic times. They willingly 
offered her their allegiance. Under Sindel's governance, the realms of Edenia 
and Outworld remain merged in spirit. <hr color="#333333">
