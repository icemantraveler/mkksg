<u><b>10 Extra Credits:</b></u><br>
In the Japanese version, press <img alt="Left" border="0" height="15" src="../images/dir_b.png" title="Left" width="15"> <img alt="Up" border="0" height="15" src="../images/dir_u.png" title="Up" width="15">

You will hear a sound if done correct.<br>
This will give you 10 extra credits.<u><br>
<b><br>
Play As Reptile:</b></u> (Requires Game Genie)<br>
This code (656A-47AF) is actually a couple codes in one. So to make it easier I'll explain it as if you were using the code in a one player or two player game.<br>
<br>
If you're playing a one player game, start as anyone you want. After you beat the person from the 1st match you will start another match, this time against Reptile. You will keep fighting Reptile until you turn off the Game Genie. If you do turn off the Game 
Genie you will continue your game as usual. If you turn the Game Genie back on, after you beat your opponent you will fight Reptile again. If you lose a match to Reptile, and you continue, you will continue as Scorpion. But if you lose and don't continue, 
you can watch the computer play against itself as Reptile vs. Reptile (one says Scorpion). If you want to start a new game, let the computer beat itself and don't continue. You will then go to the title screen.<br>
<br>
If you're playing a 2 player game, player 2 can play as Reptile, sort of. Start a 2 player game and have player 2 choose Scorpion or Sub-Zero as their fighter. Then have player 2 beat up player 1 and don't continue. The next match will then be against Reptile. 
Have player 1 join in. Player 1 will automatically start as Scorpion. Then when player 2 begins playing, Scorpion or Sub-Zero will be in Reptile's green uniform and it will say Reptile in your energy bar. But even though you look like Reptile, you still can't 
do both Scorpions and Sub-Zero's special moves. You can only do one or the others. If you choose someone other than those two fighters, your character will be a strange green color.<br>
<br>
For a little added &quot;bonus&quot;, try the code 676A-47AF. This code has a little glitch, but it still works fine.<br>

<u><b>Secret Music Tracks and Sound Samples:</b></u><br>
To access secret music and sound samples, go to options and highlight &quot;Sound FX&quot;. Move the number along to 17. Now tap <img alt="Right" border="0" height="15" src="../images/dir_f.png" title="Right" width="15"> and <b>A</b> repeatedly until the irritating 
'drring' sound stops. After a while (about a minute, maybe less), it will play a weird sample that is nowhere in the game. Leave it longer and it will play really strange stuff. Be patient, there is a long interval between each sample.<br>
