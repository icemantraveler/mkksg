<b><br>
Play As Reptile:</b></u> (Requires Game Genie)<br>
This code (656A-47AF) is actually a couple codes in one. So to make it easier 
I'll explain it as if you were using the code in a one player or two player 
game.<br>
<br>
If you're playing a one player game, start as anyone you want. After you beat 
the person from the 1st match you will start another match, this time against 
Reptile. You will keep fighting Reptile until you turn off the Game Genie. If 
you do turn off the Game Genie you will continue your game as usual. If you turn 
the Game Genie back on, after you beat your opponent you will fight Reptile 
again. If you lose a match to Reptile, and you continue, you will continue as 
Scorpion. But if you lose and don't continue, you can watch the computer play 
against itself as Reptile vs. Reptile (one says Scorpion). If you want to start 
a new game, let the computer beat itself and don't continue. You will then go to 
the title screen.<br>
<br>
If you're playing a 2 player game, player 2 can play as Reptile, sort of. Start 
a 2 player game and have player 2 choose Scorpion or Sub-Zero as their fighter. 
Then have player 2 beat up player 1 and don't continue. The next match will then 
be against Reptile. Have player 1 join in. Player 1 will automatically start as 
Scorpion. Then when player 2 begins playing, Scorpion or Sub-Zero will be in 
Reptile's green uniform and it will say Reptile in your energy bar. But even 
though you look like Reptile, you still can't do both Scorpions and Sub-Zero's 
special moves. You can only do one or the others. If you choose someone other 
than those two fighters, your character will be a strange green color.<br>
<br>
For a little added &quot;bonus&quot;, try the code 676A-47AF. This code has a little 
glitch, but it still works fine.<br>
