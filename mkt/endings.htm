When Baraka's failure to apprehend several Earth warriors nearly results in Shao 
Kahn's demise, the nomad finds himself fearing for his own life. He falls out of 
favor with his emperor, and realizes that it's only a matter of time before Kahn 
enacts revenge. Baraka remains loyal until the opposition from the Earth realm has 
been defeated.<br>
With Kahn in a weakened state from his battle with Raiden, Baraka strikes. The despondent 
emperor is no match for Baraka's attack. Then, fearing reprisal from those loyal 
to Kahn, Baraka escapes back into nomadic ruins from which he came.<hr class="main">

Cyrax is captured by Sub-Zero and reprogrammed with new orders: to destroy Shao 
Kahn. With Kahn unable to detect his assassin's soulless presence, Cyrax delivers 
a successful sneak attack.<br>
However, after eliminating Kahn and saving Earth, Cyrax awaits new orders from his 
Lin Kuei headquarters. The orders never come and Cyrax malfunctions. He ends up 
stranded in the middle of a vast desert, blindly heading toward his base.<hr class="main">

<a href="#top">
<img alt="Ending" border="1" height="147" src="../umk3/end_ermac.jpg" title="Ending" width="272"></a><br>
When Kahn finally eliminates his opposition, he finds a new and surprising foe in 
Ermac. The Outworld souls that give life to the warrior did not trust their tyrannical 
leader who planned to consume the powerful life for his own power.<br>
Even Shao Kahn's power was no match for the overwhelming strength of legions of 
deceased Outworld warriors. They destroyed their master in a battle that devastated 
the entire realm. Ermac was left behind to rule it with his own brand of oppression.<hr class="main">

<img alt="Ending" border="1" height="147" src="../umk3/end_jade.jpg" title="Ending" width="272"></a><br>
Jade makes the decision to assist her longtime friend, Kitana. She thwarts an assassination 
attempt by Reptile against the princess and fends off their other Outworld enemies.<br>
This clears the path for Kitana to turn Sindel against the emperor Shao Kahn. With 
Sindel removed as an enemy Jade finds herself facing the emperor in kombat.<br>
She defeats him and both Earth and her former homeland of Edenia are transformed 
to their original states. Jade has earned herself a place alongside the great heroes 
of Mortal Kombat.<hr class="main">

The second time Jax battles the forces of Shao Kahn he comes prepared. Thought to 
be the strongest man on Earth, he has no problem proving it: First by beating Kahn's 
armies and then by defeating the Emperor himself.<br>
When the world reverts back to normal, Jax and Sonya start the Outerworld Investigation 
Agency. Jax runs the exploratory division which learns to open portals through science 
rather than magic. He leads the first expedition into a mysterious new realm.<hr class="main">

With his nearly deceased soul restored, Johnny Cage finds himself fighting alongside 
his friends once again. This time he seeks revenge against the extermination squad 
that took his life. But during their battle, Cage learns that if they win against 
Kahn, his soul will again be deceased when Earth reverts back to normal.<br>
Knowing this the movie star embarks on a one way mission to destroy Shao Kahn. His 
determination fuels his fellow warriors as they embark on one final onslaught against 
the evil emperor. The Earth warriors emerge victorious and when the realms revert 
to their normal state, Cage bids farewell to his comrades as his soul leaves to 
a higher place.<hr class="main">

After returning from near death, Kabal swears revenge against his attackers. He 
fights alongside the other Earth warriors. When he defeats Motaro and the mighty 
Shao Kahn he proves that he truly is the chosen one.<br>
Before the invasion, Kabal lived a life of crime. He was once a member of the Black 
Dragon along with Kano. Now Kabal devotes his life to fighting injustice. He will 
give crime's inner circles a new reason to fear.<hr class="main">

When Shao Kahn lets Kano live he fails to realize the resourcefulness of the scheming 
human. Kano lures Kahn's armies away on a false mission: then nukes them using a 
stolen weapon. He fights the remaining warriors and finally defeats Kahn himself.<br>
Kano's true intention is to take over the souls which Kahn once possessed. But Kano 
is unable to control the spirits as they escape and attack him. Rumored to have 
suffered a violent death, Kano was ignorant of the fact that he saved the world 
he tried to conquer.<hr class="main">

Kitana evades the evil clutches of Shao Kahn and escapes into the unknown regions 
of Earth. She survives an assassination attempt by the vile creature Reptile, and 
allies herself with her onetime comrade - Jade.<br>
Together with the help of Earth's warriors Kitana reaches Sindel and turns the queen 
against her emperor. With Shao Kahn defeated the Earth is charged back to its original 
state, as is Kitana's realm of Edenia.<br>
She will be forever in debt to her friends from Earth as she rules the new realm

When Shao Kahn invades Earth, Kung Lao must scrap his plans of reuniting the White 
Lotus Society. He instead must focus on the new tournament. He seeks Liu Kang and 
together they battle Kahn's forces fearlessly.<br>
Using the knowledge he obtained as a Shaolin monk he fights in the name of his great 
ancestor - the original Kung Lao. He emerges victorious but suffers from injuries 
during battle with Kahn. Believed to have passed away, Kung Lao joins his ancestors

After thwarting Shao Kahn in the past, Liu Kang finds himself the prime target of 
Shao Kahn's extermination squads. But Kang is the reigning Mortal Kombat champion 
and proves it by easily defeating Kahn's minions.<br>
But it's the apparent death of his friend Kung Lao that enrages Kang and enables 
him to find the strength to defeat Shao Kahn. Then, before the portal closes, Liu 
Kang is greeted by Princess Kitana and thanked for saving the Earth and the Outworld.<hr class="main">

<img alt="Ending" border="1" height="147" src="../umk3/end_mileena.jpg" title="Ending" width="272"></a><br>
When Mileena is murdered, she finds her soul reborn in an evil place called the 
Netherrealm. Here she accepts servitude to an all mighty god known as Shinnok. It 
is Shinnok who allows her soul to be reborn on the Outworld. Her loyalty to Shao 
Kahn is replaced by her fear of Shinnok. Mileena plots to overthrow her own father.<br>
The ability to read Kitana's mind and predict the Earth warriors motives, enables 
Mileena to set up her father's downfall. When Kahn is weakened by the onslaught 
of attacks, Mileena takes the opportunity to destroy her father and allow Shinnok 
to step forward and take both realms for his own sinister purposes..<hr class="main">

trained hard for this battle. Finally, he faces Shao Kahn and emerges victorious.<br>
When the Earth returns to its normal state, Nightwolf peacefully regains his land

At first a passive observer, Noob Saibot would soon receive orders to side with 
the evil emperor Shao Kahn. Saibot's leaders in the Netherrealm want him to join 
Kahn's battle to gain his trust and to gain entrance into the Earth realm.<br>
When Kahn drops his guard, Noob Saibot is ordered to attack. With both the Earth 
realm and the Outworld's emperor defeated, the fallen elder god known as Shinnok 
can take both realms and gain the power he needs to strike back at the elder gods

Rain fights valiantly for the emperor Shao Kahn. But it would be Kahn's own step 
daughter, the princess Kitana who turns Rain against him. Like Kitana, Rain's origins 
also come from their former realm of Edenia.<br>
He learns that his father was once a general in Edenia's army and died at the hands 
of Shao Kahn himself. Enraged at the truth about his history, he joins Kitana in 
aligning with the Earth Realm warriors.<br>
But his allegiance comes under question when he mysteriously disappears during an

to be Sub-Zero. Scorpion has vowed to protect the former ninja as restitution for 
killing his brother.<br>
Shao Kahn finds himself the victim of his own scheme as Scorpion is forced to turn 
against him. He destroys the emperor and the Earth is returned to normal.<br>
Scorpion finds himself once again roaming the pits of Hell, only to one day rise

After learning this, Tsung turns on his master. He catches Motaro off guard and
