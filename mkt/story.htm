The Story<hr class="main">

Thousands of years ago an order of the<br>
wisest men from the far East received visions<br>
of the dark realm known as The Outworld. It<br>
was a world ruled by chaos and a vicious<br>
emperor known as Shao Kahn.<br>
<br>
They learned that travel between Earth and<br>
the new found realm would someday be possible<br>
if the conditions were right, the conditions<br>
being the unbalancing of the furies - negative<br>
and positive forces which keep our unstable<br>
universe from collapsing onto itself.<br>
<br>
Knowing that an Outworld invasion was<br>
imminent, the wise men appealed to the Elder<br>
Gods. It was for this reason the Elder Gods<br>
created the tournament called Mortal Kombat.<br>
<br>
For nine generations Mortal Kombat was<br>
ruled by Outworld's finest warrior - Prince<br>
Goro. The Earth was on the brink of its<br>
destruction when a new generation of<br>
warriors were victorious in defending<br>
it's realm.<br>
<br>
The warrior monk, Liu Kang would become<br>
the new champion, but his victory was<br>
short lived as he and his comrades find<br>
themselves lured into The Outworld to<br>
compete in a second tournament.<br>
<br>
Little did they know that the tournament<br>
was merely a diversion. A scheme devised<br>
by the dark emperor to break the rules set<br>
forth by the Elder Gods and witness the<br>
reincarnation of his former queen Sindel<br>
on the Earth realm itself.<br>
<br>
This unholy act gives Shao Kahn the power<br>
to step through the dimensional gates<br>
and reclaim his queen, thus enabling him<br>
to finally seize the Earth.<br>
<br>
These are the trilogy of events which<br>
comprise Shao Kahn's final attempt at<br>
taking the Earth.</center>
