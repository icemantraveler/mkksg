When Baraka's failure to apprehend several Earth Warriors nearly results in Shao Kahn's demise, the nomad finds himself fearing for his own life.<br>
<br>
He falls out of favor with his emperor, and realizes that it's only a matter of time before Kahn enacts revenge. Baraka remains loyal until the opposition from the Earthrealm has been defeated.<br>
<br>
With Kahn in a weakened state from his battle with Raiden, Baraka strikes. The despondent emperor is no match for Baraka's attack. Then, fearing reprisal from those loyal to Kahn, Baraka escapes back into the nomadic ruins from which he came.<hr class="main">

Cyrax is captured by Sub-Zero and reprogrammed with new orders: Destroy Shao Kahn. With Kahn unable to detect the assassin's soulless presence, Cyrax delivers a successful sneak attack.<br>
<br>
But, after eliminating Kahn and saving Earth, Cyrax awaits new orders from his Lin Kuei headquarters. The orders never come and Cyrax malfunctions. He ends up stranded in the middle of a vast desert, blindly heading toward his base.<hr class="main">

<a href="#top"><img alt="Ending" border="1" class="logo" height="384" src="ending_mkt_ermac.png" title="Ending" width="768"></a><br>
When Kahn finally eliminates his opposition, he finds a new and surprising foe in Ermac. The Outworld souls that give life to the warrior did not trust their tyrannical leader who planned to consume the powerful life force for his own power.<br>
<br>
Even Shao Kahn's power was no match for the overwhelming strength of legions of deceased Outworld Warriors. They destroyed their master in a battle that devastated the entire realm. Ermac was left behind to rule it with his own brand of oppression.<hr class="main">

Jade makes the decision to assist her longtime friend, Kitana. She thwarts an assassination attempt by Reptile against the princess and fends off their other Outworld enemies.<br>
<br>
This clears the path for Kitana to turn Sindel against the emperor, Shao Kahn. With Sindel removed as an enemy, Jade finds herself facing the emperor in kombat.<br>
<br>
She defeats him and both Earth and her former homeland of Edenia are transformed to their original states. Jade has earned herself a place alongside the great heroes of Mortal Kombat.<hr class="main">

The second time Jax battles the forces of Shao Kahn he comes prepared. Thought to be the strongest man on Earth, he has no problem proving it: First by beating Kahn's armies then by defeating the Emperor himself.<br>
<br>
When the world reverts back to normal, Jax and Sonya start the Outer World Investigation Agency. Jax runs the exploratory division which learns to open portals through science rather than magic. He leads the first expedition into a mysterious new realm.<hr class="main">

With his nearly deceased soul restored, Johnny Cage finds himself fighting alongside his friends once again. This time he seeks revenge against the extermination squad that took his life.<br>
<br>
But during their battle, Cage learns that if they win against Kahn, his soul will again be deceased when Earth reverts back to normal. Knowing this, the movie star embarks on a one-way mission to destroy Shao Kahn.<br>
<br>
His determination fuels his fellow warriors as they embark on one final onslaught against the evil emperor. The Earth Warriors emerge victorious and when the realms revert to their normal state, Cage bids farewell to his comrades as his soul leaves to a higher 
place.<hr class="main">

After returning from near death, Kabal swears revenge against his attackers. He fights alongside the other Earth Warriors. When he defeats Motaro and the mighty Shao Kahn, he proves that he truly is the chosen one.<br>
<br>
Before the invasion, Kabal lived a life of crime. He was once a member of the Black Dragon along with Kano. Now Kabal devotes his life to fighting injustice. He will give crime's inner circles a new reason to fear.<hr class="main">

When Shao Kahn lets Kano live, he fails to realize the resourcefulness of the scheming human. Kano lures Kahn's army away on a false mission, then nukes them using a stolen weapon. He fights the remaining warriors and finally defeats Kahn himself.<br>
<br>
Kano's true intention is to take over the souls which Kahn once possessed. But Kano is unable to control the spirits as they escape and attack him. Rumored to have suffered a violent death, Kano was ignorant of the fact that he saved the world he tried to 
conquer.<hr class="main">

Kitana evades the evil clutches of Shao Kahn and escapes into the unknown regions of Earth. She survives an assassination attempt by the vile creature Reptile, and allies herself with her onetime comrade - Jade.<br>
<br>
Together with the help of Earth's warriors, Kitana reaches Sindel and turns the queen against her emperor. With Shao Kahn defeated, the Earth is changed back to its original state, as is Kitana's realm of Edenia.<br>
<br>
She will be forever in debt to her friends from Earth as she rules the new realm of Edenia at Queen Sindel's side.<hr class="main">

When Shao Kahn invades Earth, Kung Lao must scrap his plans of reuniting the White Lotus Society. He instead must focus on the new tournament. He seeks Liu Kang and together they battle Kahn's forces fearlessly.<br>
<br>
Using the knowledge he obtained as a Shaolin monk, he fights in the name of his great ancestor - the original Kung Lao. He emerges victorious but suffers from injuries during battle with Kahn. Believed to have passed away, Kung Lao joins his ancestor in a 
new life.<hr class="main">

After thwarting Shao Kahn in the past, Liu Kang finds himself the main target of Kahn's extermination squads. But Kang is the reigning Mortal Kombat champion and proves it by easily defeating Kahn's minions.<br>
<br>
But it's the apparent death of his friend Kung Lao that enrages Kang and enables him to find the strength to defeat Shao Kahn. Then, before the portal closes, Liu Kang is greeted by Princess Kitana and thanked for saving the Earth and the Outworld.<hr class="main">

When Mileena is murdered, she finds her soul reborn in an evil place called the Netherrealm. Here she accepts servitude to an all-mighty god known as Shinnok. It is Shinnok who allows her soul to be reborn on the Outworld.<br>
<br>
Her loyalty to Shao Kahn is replaced by her fear of Shinnok. Mileena plots to overthrow her own father. The ability to read Kitana's mind and predict the Earth warrior's motives enables Mileena to set up her father's downfall.<br>
<br>
When Kahn is weakened by the onslaught of attacks, Mileena takes the opportunity to destroy her father and allow Shinnok to step forward and take both realms for his own sinister purposes.<hr class="main">

Nightwolf helps other Earth warriors escape to his sacred land. Once there, they regroup and form a plan of attack against Shao Kahn's invasion. Nightwolf has trained hard for this battle. Finally, he faces Shao Kahn and emerges victorious.<br>
<br>
When the Earth returns to its normal state, Nightwolf peacefully regains his lands his Native-American people lost over many years. They establish their own proud nation and soon become the great leaders of Earth.<hr class="main">

At first a passive observer, Noob Saibot would soon receive orders to side with the evil emperor Shao Kahn. Saibot's leaders in the Netherrealm want him to join Kahn's battle to gain his trust and to gain entrance into the Earthrealm.<br>
<br>
When Kahn drops his guard, Noob Saibot is ordered to attack. With both the Earthrealm and the Outworld's emperor defeated, the fallen elder god known as Shinnok can take both realms and gain the power he needs to strike back at the elder gods who banished 
him into the Netherrealm.<hr class="main">

When Outworld and Earth merge, Raiden finds himself battling Shao Kahn without the assistance of the Elder Gods. The Thunder God must transform into a mortal in order to exist in the combined realms.<br>

When he does this, he puts his own immortality at risk. But Raiden has always found ways of fouling Kahn's plots. He guides the chosen Earth Warriors into battle against the Outworld emperor's armies, then finally faces Kahn himself.<br>

Rain fights valiantly for the emperor Shao Kahn. But it would be Kahn's own step-daughter, the princess Kitana, who turns Rain against him. Like Kitana, Rain's origins also come from their former realm of Edenia.<br>
<br>
He learns that his father was once a general in Edenia's army and died at the hands of Shao Kahn himself. Enraged at the truth about his history, he joins Kitana in aligning with the Earthrealm warriors.<br>
<br>
But his allegiance comes under question when he mysteriously disappears during an extermination squad attack. To prove his loyalty, he embarked on a suicide mission to destroy Shao Kahn and end the menace once and for all.<hr class="main">

<br>
But, his allegiance to Shao Kahn falters when he discovers one of the chosen warriors to be Sub-Zero. Scorpion has vowed to protect the former ninja as restitution for killing his brother.<br>
<br>
Shao Kahn finds himself the victim of his own scheme as Scorpion is forced to turn against him. He destroys the emperor and the Earth is returned to normal.<br>
Scorpion finds himself once again roaming the pits of Hell, only to one day rise again.<hr class="main">

When Shao Kahn overtakes the Earth, he needs Shang Tsung to help locate the surviving humans. Granted new powers, Tsung soon discovers his dark emperor's true plan: as soon as the remaining warriors are disposed of, Kahn will take Tsung's own soul.<br>
<br>
