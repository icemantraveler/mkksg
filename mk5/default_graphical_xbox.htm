<b>Bio:</b><br>
During the years that Shang Tsung sponsored the Mortal Kombat tournaments on 
earth, the Outworld master Bo' Rai Cho was secretly training warriors for 
competition. It was even speculated that it was he who brought the fighting 
style of Drunken Boxing to Earthrealm. After many years, he finally discovered 
the Shaolin monk Liu Kang and taught him the martial arts moves he needed to 
defeat Shang Tsung. Later, with the tournament securely in the hands of the 
Shaolin, his teachings were no longer needed and he returned to Outworld.<br>
Bo' Rai Cho had been unable to compete against Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat 
tournament on Earth, his Outworld birthplace guaranteed that his victory would 
have been in the name of Shao Kahn. But the conflict this time was not a 
tournament to prevent an evil emperor from consuming another realm. The time the 
battle was to save his own realm from the tyranny of two evil sorcerers. Nothing 
could hold him back from the challenge that lay before him. The wrath of Bo' Rai 
Cho would be unleashed once again.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Johnny Cage had been fed up with the lame writing on his current movie &quot;Mortal 
Kombat: The Death of Johnny Cage&quot;, in which his character repeatedly died and 
was resurrected. To him, his real-life adventures were much more sensational - 
he kicked butt! But his studio felt that the hero needed to take a fall for 
dramatic purposes, Johnny Cage reluctantly agreed to continue with the project 
until the Thunder God Raiden called him away to a new adventure in Outworld.<br>
For maximum dramatic effect, Johnny Cage arrived on the island fortress of Shang 
Tsung by way of parachute. He glided to the exact place on the beach where 
Raiden had told him to rendezvous with the others. When night fell, the 
Earthrealm kombatants lit a fire and discussed possible strategies to defeat the 
Outworld threat. Once the fire had reached its full strength, Raiden finally 
appeared and revealed to them the events that had led to the formation of the 
Deadly Alliance.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Kano had been defeated in a battle with Special Forces agent Sonya Blade during 
Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm. Shao Kahn incarcerated Kano for his failure, 
but later hastily promoted him to General when he prevented the Emperor's 
assassination at the hands of the Shokan warrior known as Sheeva. With the 
merging of Earthrealm and Outworld not yet complete, Shao Kahn ordered Kano to 
portal back to the last remnants of Outworld to gather more troops for the final 
push against the Earthrealm opposition.<br>
Kano had remained in Outworld and served as General of Shao Kahn's military 
after the retreat from Earthrealm. For years he enjoyed the power of commanding 
the greatest army in Outworld. But Shao Kahn's power was fading and there was a 
chance that Kitana's forces might spell the Emperor's undoing. When the 
sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi confronted Shao Kahn in a surprise attack, 
Kano decided not to interfere and remained hidden in the shadows to ally with 
the winning side. Once Shao Kahn was defeated, Kano offered his allegiance to 
the Deadly Alliance.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Sensing the cries of his captured ancestors, Kenshi made a vow to slay Shang 
Tsung in order to free them from his grasp. When he learned of Shang Tsung's 
escape to Outworld, Kenshi agreed to help the Special Forces search for the 
missing agent Cyrax as a means of gaining access to that realm, which allowed 
him to act as both rescue party and spy. Shortly after discovering the 
sorcerer's whereabouts, the Agency was destroyed and with it his only means for 
a return to Earth. Kenshi now finds himself facing the Deadly Alliance on his 
own.<br>
Years ago, the rogue swordsman Kenshi wandered Japan to challenge the greatest 
warriors. His purpose in life was simply to be the best. Shang Tsung, however, 
had discovered Kenshi's true heritage as a descendant of a long forgotten line 
of warrior kings. The sorcerer desired to consume the souls of those warrior 
kings and tricked the unknowing Kenshi into releasing them from their tomb, an 
act which left him blinded. Shang Tsung consumed the souls and left Kenshi to 
die in the tomb.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Kung Lao was the first to find the body of his friend and fellow Shaolin Monk 
Liu Kang. He later discovered that it was in fact Shang Tsung who had dealt the 
fatal blow. Enraged, Kung Lao abandoned his Shaolin beliefs and vowed revenge 
against the sorcerer. He knew that his fighting skill would not be sufficient to 
best Shang Tsung. He would need training from the same Outworld master who had 
taught Liu Kang the one special attack he needed to win the Mortal Kombat 
tournament so many years ago.<br>
Kung Lao traveled to Outworld and informed the martial arts master, Bo' Rai Cho, 
of Liu Kang's death at the hands of the sorcerer Shang Tsung. Devastated by the 
news, the old master agreed to teach Kung Lao the flying kick Liu Kang had used 
to defeat Shang Tsung a decade ago. The training was intense, but Bo' Rai Cho 
was determined to give Kung Lao a greater edge than he had given Liu Kang. Once 
Kung Lao had mastered the &quot;whirlwind Kick&quot;, both he and Bo' Rai Cho journeyed 
across Outworld to deal with the sorcerer Shang Tsung.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
The Deadly Alliance commanded Kano and his troops to force a small population of 
people to construct a palace fortress. One of those enslaved was Li Mei, who 
rebelled against the invaders and attacked Kano himself. Recognizing the warrior 
spirit she possessed, the sorcerer Quan Chi offered to free her people if she 
could win the Deadly Alliance Tournament. If she did not win, however, she would 
be forced to serve the Alliance and her people would remain slaves forever. Li 
Mei had no choice but to accept the offer.<br>
During the construction of Shang Tsung's palace, Li Mei discovered that it would 
be constructed around the ancient stone structure located on a nearby plateau. 
Her people have regarded the relic as sacred for as long as anyone could 
remember. Legends told that it was a portal to the heavens left behind by the 
gods themselves. When Quan Chi activated the portal with his mysterious amulet 
and countless souls spewed forth, trapped between the realms, it was clear that 
the legends had been true.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

The Red Dragon had existed for centuries as a secretive criminal organization. 
members such as Mavado were highly skilled and disciplined warriors. But in the 
last century, many of the more reckless members became dissatisfied with the 
restraints the code of the Red Dragon placed on them and broke away to form 
their own gang. Since then, it has been the Red Dragon's number one priority to 
completely eradicate the infidels known collectively as the Black Dragon.<br>
It was thought that the Black Dragon had been completely destroyed until Mavado 
was approached by the two sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi. The sorcerers 
offered to hand over the last member of the Black Dragon, Kano, in return for 
Mavado's assistance in eliminating a spy in Outworld. Mavado accepted the offer 
and traveled to Outworld with Quan Chi and Shang Tsung by way of a secret 
inter-realm portal located in the Lost Sea. The swordsman who had been spying on 
Shang Tsung for the past few months would soon be eliminated.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Stranded in The Netherrealm, Quan Chi was persistently tormented by the ninja 
specter Scorpion. But with assistance from Moloch and Drahmin, Quan Chi 
discovered the truth about the amulet he had stolen from the fallen Elder God 
Shinnok. An ancient Rune Stone bearing the likeness of his amulet revealed new 
information that would enable Quan Chi to traverse the realms through a network 
of ancient gateways. Narrowly evading Scorpion's wrath, he escaped The 
Netherrealm through one of these gateways and emerged in an ancient tomb in 
Outworld.<br>
Quan Chi had stumbled upon the ancient mummified army of the long-forgotten 
Dragon King. Writings on the King's sarcophagus had revealed that the army was 
invincible and that it could be revived. Quan Chi struck a deal with the 
sorcerer Shang Tsung to resuscitate the army in return for the constant supply 
of souls his amulet could unlock from a gateway to the Heavens. Before any 
alliance between the two could succeed, however, their two strongest opponents 
would have to be eliminated.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

The ninja Scorpion had assumed for many years that Sub-Zero killed his family 
and clan, only to later discover that the true murderer was the sorcerer Quan 
Chi. After revealing his treachery, Quan Chi then attempted to send Scorpion to 
the 5th plane of the Netherrealm. Thinking quickly, Scorpion grappled with the 
sorcerer at the last moment and they were both transported to that forbidden 
realm. This turn of events boded well for Scorpion as his strength increased the 
longer he remained there. Quan Chi's powers, however, proved to be useless 
against him.<br>
Scorpion hunted Quan Chi relentlessly throughout the Netherrealm, thrashing him 
every chance he could. Eventually, Quan Chi enlisted the help of two Oni to 
protect him from the onslaught. When Quan Chi finally discovered a way out of 
the Netherrealm through a strange portal, Scorpion rushed to follow him. He 
emerged in Outworld but in a different location, far from his prey. He can still 
sense Quan Chi's presence and will hunt him wherever he runs to. There is 
nowhere the sorcerer can hide.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

The sorcerer Shang Tsung was imprisoned in the depths of Shao Kahn's fortress, 
punished for failing to win the Mortal Kombat tournament in Earthrealm. 
Periodically he was released to perform tasks for the emperor, until he 
eventually regained Shao Kahn's favor and was given his freedom. he remained in 
Outworld risking his life to drain the souls of kombatants in order to sustain 
his youth. All this changed the day the sorcerer Quan Chi returned from the 
Netherrealm.<br>
Quan Chi proposed an alliance with Shang Tsung that would prove to be mutually 
beneficial. He offered Shang Tsung immortality by unlocking a portal linked to 
the Heavens. Shang Tsung would therefore have access to an unlimited number of 
souls to preserve his youth. In return, all Quan Chi required was Shang Tsung's 
assistance in transplanting warrior souls into the mummified remains of the 
Dragon King's undefeatable army. Shang Tsung accepted the offer and the Deadly 
Alliance was formed.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

Agent Sonya Blade and her team had finished their mission of demolishing any 
known ancient inter-realm portals when she received word from Jax that the 
Agency's portal chamber had been destroyed. With no means for traversing the 
realms, Sonya realized that there were now two agents lost in Outworld. The 
first was the ninjas cyborg Cyrax, whom the agency had lost contact with some 
time ago. And now agent Kenshi, originally sent to find Cyrax, was lost as well. 
She would have to find a way to get to Outworld and bring them home.<br>
Sonya was instructed to accompany Jax to an island in the Lost Sea where the 
Thunder God Raiden would meet them. The island had once been the location of her 
first Mortal Kombat tournament a decade ago. Now it was an abandoned reminder of 
the struggle between Earthrealm and the forces of evil. As she and the other 
heroes waited for Raiden to appear, she came to the realization that this time 
she had no plan of attack. All Sonya knew for sure was that somehow she had to 
rescue her fellow agents. As her Special Forces training dictated, no man would

The cyborg ninja Cyrax regained his soul with the aid of Special Forces agents

Outworld. On his last transport to that realm, a reptilian creature ambushed 
Cyrax. His arm console was damaged in the struggle and with it his Inter-realm 
portal technology. He defeated the creature, but will have to find some other 
means to return to Earthrealm.<br>
A vampire woman named Nitara offered Cyrax a deal to return him to Earthrealm if 
he retrieved for her an object from the molten depths of Outworld. His 
cybernetic exterior was resistant to the harsh environment in which the object 
was hidden, but only for a short period of time. It was a risky proposition, but 
it was one that Cyrax was willing to take to return to Earth. Although he did 
not fully trust Nitara, he agreed to travel with her to the location of the 
mysterious object.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
The Oni Tormenter Drahmin resided in the 5th plane of The Netherrealm for 
centuries. It was therefore no surprise to Moloch that Drahmin would so readily 
accept Quan Chi's offer of freedom from that realm in return for protection from 
the ninja specter Scorpion. Drahmin and Moloch savagely brutalized Scorpion 
whenever he made a move for Quan Chi. It would not be long before they would be 
released upon the world of the living and taste mortal flesh once more.<br>
Drahmin had led Quan Chi to a structure that housed the remnants of ancient 
tablets and runestones dating back to the creation of the realms. Quan Chi's eye 
was caught by a tablet with an image that bore a striking resemblance to his 
amulet. The engraved writing revealed the amulet's hidden power to control 
inter-realm portals. Breaking his promise, Quan Chi betrayed Moloch and Drahmin 
and used the amulet to escape The Netherrealm without them. Unknown to Quan Chi, 
however, the two Oni also escaped and are now thirsty for revenge.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

Sub-Zero had reformed the Lin Kuei clan and held a tournament to recruit the 
best of the best. the winner was a mysterious female named Frost who seemed to 
have freezing abilities similar to those of Sub-Zero. Breaking with Lin Kuei 
tradition, the new Grand Master, Sub-Zero, took it upon himself to train this 
new recruit. With his help, Frost was able to better harness her Kori powers. 
Sub-Zero was not able to teach her humility, however, and her arrogance grew 
along with her superior fighting abilities.<br>
At request of the Thunder God Raiden, Sub-Zero journeyed to Outworld to help 
defeat the Deadly Alliance. Frost accompanied him to aid her new mentor and to 
gain more experience as a warrior. By participating in real-world battles, 
Sub-Zero had hoped that Frost would gain perspective and enlightenment. But 
unknown to Sub-Zero, Frost had other reasons for following him into Outworld. 
She was merely waiting for the right moment to reveal her true intentions.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

ranks as an informant until further notice. That notice came when his superior

Hsu Hao gained access to an Ion Pulse bomb and infiltrated the heavily

Jax spent most of his time in the heavily fortified underground facilities of 
the Outerworld Investigation Agency. From an enormous underground chamber, Jax 
would send his agents to the other realms by way of man-made inter-realm 
portals. Two of his agents, the cyborg ninja Cyrax and the rouge swordsman 
Kenshi, had been assigned to the realm of Outworld - a domain of strange 
creatures and maniacal sorcerers. Jax would soon be reminded of just how 
dangerous a threat to Earth that realm could be.<br>
After receiving information from Agent Kenshi about a new threat from Outworld, 
Jax barely escaped with his life when a traitor destroyed all means for 
inter-realm travel. The Outerworld Investigation Agency was completely 
obliterated. But with the help of the Thunder God Raiden, Jax eventually made it 
to Outworld to deal with the traitor who now served the Deadly Alliance. Jax 
swore that he would show no mercy to the one responsible for the destruction.

Having freed her home world of Edenia from Shao Kahn's grasp, Kitana led her 
people to battle against the weakened Emperor in a pre-emptive strike. She 
allied with the Shokan armies of Outworld, led by Prince Goro, and together 
their two nations were on the brink of victory. Tragedy struck when Goro was

strange turn of events, Shao Kahn was slain by unknown assailants and Kano's 
troops began a hasty retreat. Kitana had one, but at a terrible cost to the 
Shokan people.<br>
The last of the Emperor Shao Kahn's armies had retreated and it seemed to Kitana 
that a new era of peace was at hand. But when a small number of hideous undead 
soldiers began to appear under the banner of the sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan 
Chi, her dreams of returning to the realm of Edenia would have to wait. Her army

together beautifully.<br>
Nitara offered to send Cyrax back to Earthrealm if he could retrieve the Orb 
from its hiding place. Nitara carried a gemstone around her neck. These 
gemstones made it possible for her people to traverse the realms. They had done 
so for ages and had even visited Earthrealm regularly in search of blood. Cyrax

this foresight, they all stood firm on their decision not to interfere. All, 
that is, except for one - Raiden. The former God of Thunder pleaded with his

relinquished his Elder God status and returned to Earthrealm to gather support 
against the coming storm.<br>
Raiden returned to Earthrealm to reunite with his comrades and inform them of 
the impending threat from the Deadly Alliance. Those that accepted his call to 
arms were instructed to meet him on Shang Tsung's old island fortress, located

Reptile had discovered the plot devised by Shang Tsung and Quan Chi to 
assassinate Shao Kahn, but on his way to inform his master, he was distracted by 
a vampire woman named Nitara. She led him to the hidden base camp of Kitana's 
fortress. Knowing the location of the base would be a great help to the Emperor 
in the war against Edenia and the Shokan. Eager to relay all that he had 
learned, Reptile raced back to Shao Kahn's fortress, only to discover him lying 
dead on the throne room floor.<br>
Reptile's detour to Kitana's base camp had delayed him just long enough for 
Shang Tsung and Quan Chi to spring their attack on Shao Kahn. Reptile was 
devastated that he had failed his master and wandered the Outworld wastelands 
aimlessly until he once again crossed paths with Nitara. Desperately in need of 
a master, he offered his loyalty to her. Her first command to him was to attack 
the invader from Earthrealm, Cyrax. She explained that he must first destroy his 
arm panel in order to weaken the outsider.<hr color="#1a1a1a">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
The mysterious Outworld elemental known only as Blaze had long been on a quest 
throughout the realm. During his quest, an ancient set of holy men still serving 
the long dead Dragon King ambushed him on a bridge. The holy men enslaved him 
through mystic incantations and forced him to protect the last known Great 
Dragon egg. For many years he has remained submerged beneath the molten rock of 
the incubation chamber as &quot;Guardian of the Egg&quot;.<hr color="#1a1a1a">
