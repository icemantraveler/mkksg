<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
Jax spent most of his time in the heavily fortified underground facilities of the 
Outerworld Investigation Agency. The agency was created to gather information about 
other realms in an effort to prevent threats to Earthrealm. From an enormous underground 
chamber, Jax would send his agents to other realms by way man - made inter-realm 
portals. Two of his agents, the cyborg ninja Cyrax, and the rogue swordsman Kenshi, 
were assigned to the realm of Outworld... A realm of strange creatures and dangerous 
sorcerers. After receiving information from agent Kenshi about a new threat from 
Outworld, Jax barely escaped when a traitor destroyed all means for inter-realm 
travel. The Outerworld Investigation Agency was completely obliterated. With the 
help of the thunder god Raiden, Jax eventually made it to Outworld to deal with 
the Deadly Alliance.<hr class="sub">

Status: Rogue Swordsman<br>
Alignment: Unknown<br>

Weapon: Katana<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
Years ago, the Rogue Swordsman Kenshi wandered Japan to challenge the greatest warriors. 
His purpose in life was simply to be the best. Shang Tsung, however, had discovered 
Kenshi's true heritage as a descendant of a long - forgotten line of warrior kings. 
The Sorcerer desired to consume the souls of those warrior kings and tricked the 
unknowing Kenshi into releasing them from their tomb, an act which left him blinded. 
Shang Tsung consumed the souls and left Kenshi to die in the tomb. Kenshi vowed 
to slay Shang Tsung and release his ancestors. Learning of Shang Tsung's escape 
to Outworld, he agreed to aid the Special Forces Outerworld Investigation Agency 
as a means to gain access to that realm and find the Sorcerer. Acting as both spy 
and intelligence gatherer, he searched for Shang Tsung using high tech equipment 
given to him by the agency. Shortly after he had informed Jax of a new threat in 
the form of an alliance between the sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, the agency 
was destroyed and with it his only means for return. Kenshi must now face the Deadly 
Alliance on his own.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
The ninja specter Scorpion had assumed for many years that Sub-Zero had killed his 
family and clan only to later discover that the true murderer was the sorcerer Quan 
Chi. After revealing his treachery, Quan Chi then attempted to send Scorpion to 
the 5th plane of the Netherrealm. Thinking quickly, Scorpion grappled the sorcerer 
at the last moment and they were both transported to that forbidden realm. Scorpion 
hunted Quan Chi relentlessly throughout the Netherrealm. Eventually, though, Quan 
Chi discovered a way back to Outworld through a strange Portal. Scorpion followed 
Quan Chi through the Portal, but emerged in a different location far from his prey. 
He can still sense Quan Chi's presence and will hunt him down whatever the cost.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
Agent Sonya Blade and her team had been traveling the world demolishing any known 
ancient inter-realm portals in an attempt to minimize infiltrations from other worlds. 
After destroying the last portal, she received word from Jax that the Outerworld 
Investigation Agency had been destroyed. The news meant that there were now two 
agents lost in Outworld. The first had been the ninja cyborg Cyrax whom the agency 
had lost contact with some time ago. And now Agent Kenshi, originally sent to find 
Cyrax, was lost as well. Sonya was instructed to accompany Jax to an island in the 
Lost Sea where the thunder god Raiden would meet them. Perhaps it was Raiden's intention 
to help them traverse to Outworld. All Sonya knew for sure was that she had to rescue 
her fellow agents. As her Special Forces training dictated, no man would be left 
behind.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
Kano had been defeated in a battle with Special Forces agent Sonya Blade during 
Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm. Shao Kahn incarcerated him for this failure, 
but later hastily promoted him to General when he prevented the Emperor's assassination 
at the hands of the Shokan warrior known as Sheeva. Kano has remained in Outworld 
ever since. When the two sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi confronted Shao Kahn 
in a surprise attack, Kano decided not to help his emperor and remained hidden in 
the shadows to ally with the winning side. Once Shao Kahn was defeated, Kano offered 
his allegiance to the Deadly Alliance.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
The sorcerer Shang Tsung was imprisoned in the depths of Shao Kahn's fortress, punished 
for failing to win the Mortal Kombat tournament in Earthrealm. Periodically he was 
released to perform tasks for the emperor, until he eventually regained Shao Kahn's 
favor and was given his freedom. He remained in Outworld risking his life to drain 
the souls of kombatants in order to sustain his youth. All this changed the day 
the sorcerer Quan Chi returned from the Netherrealm. Quan Chi proposed an alliance 
between the two sorcerers that would prove to be mutually beneficial. He offered 
Shang Tsung access to unlimited souls through a portal linked to the heavens in 
return for his assistance in transplanting warrior souls into the mummified remains 
of the Dragon King's undefeatable army. Shang Tsung accepted the offer and the Deadly 
Alliance was formed.<hr class="sub">
