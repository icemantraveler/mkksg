Jax spent most of his time in the heavily fortified underground facilities of 
the Outerworld Investigation Agency. The agency was created to gather 
information about other realms in an effort to prevent threats to Earthrealm. 
From an enormous underground chamber, Jax would send his agents to other realms 
by way man - made inter-realm portals. Two of his agents, the cyborg ninja 
Cyrax, and the rogue swordsman Kenshi, were assigned to the realm of Outworld... 
A realm of strange creatures and dangerous sorcerers. After receiving 
information from agent Kenshi about a new threat from Outworld, Jax barely 
escaped when a traitor destroyed all means for inter-realm travel. The 
Outerworld Investigation Agency was completely obliterated. With the help of the 
thunder god Raiden, Jax eventually made it to Outworld to deal with the Deadly 
Alliance.<hr color="#1A1A1A">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
Years ago, the Rogue Swordsman Kenshi wandered Japan to challenge the greatest 
warriors. His purpose in life was simply to be the best. Shang Tsung, however, 
had discovered Kenshi's true heritage as a descendant of a long - forgotten line 
of warrior kings. The Sorcerer desired to consume the souls of those warrior 
kings and tricked the unknowing Kenshi into releasing them from their tomb, an 
act which left him blinded. Shang Tsung consumed the souls and left Kenshi to 
die in the tomb. Kenshi vowed to slay Shang Tsung and release his ancestors. 
Learning of Shang Tsung's escape to Outworld, he agreed to aid the Special 
Forces Outerworld Investigation Agency as a means to gain access to that realm 
and find the Sorcerer. Acting as both spy and intelligence gatherer, he searched 
for Shang Tsung using high tech equipment given to him by the agency. Shortly 
after he had informed Jax of a new threat in the form of an alliance between the 
sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, the agency was destroyed and with it his 
only means for return. Kenshi must now face the Deadly Alliance on his own.<hr color="#1A1A1A">

The ninja specter Scorpion had assumed for many years that Sub-Zero had killed 
his family and clan only to later discover that the true murderer was the 
sorcerer Quan Chi. After revealing his treachery, Quan Chi then attempted to 
send Scorpion to the 5th plane of the Netherrealm. Thinking quickly, Scorpion 
grappled the sorcerer at the last moment and they were both transported to that 
forbidden realm. Scorpion hunted Quan Chi relentlessly throughout the 
Netherrealm. Eventually, though, Quan Chi discovered a way back to Outworld 
through a strange Portal. Scorpion followed Quan Chi through the Portal, but 
emerged in a different location far from his prey. He can still sense Quan Chi's 
presence and will hunt him down whatever the cost.<hr color="#1A1A1A">

<u><b>Bio:</b></u><br>
Agent Sonya Blade and her team had been traveling the world demolishing any 
known ancient inter-realm portals in an attempt to minimize infiltrations from 
other worlds. After destroying the last portal, she received word from Jax that 
the Outerworld Investigation Agency had been destroyed. The news meant that 
there were now two agents lost in Outworld. The first had been the ninja cyborg 
Cyrax whom the agency had lost contact with some time ago. And now Agent Kenshi, 
originally sent to find Cyrax, was lost as well. Sonya was instructed to 
accompany Jax to an island in the Lost Sea where the thunder god Raiden would 
meet them. Perhaps it was Raiden's intention to help them traverse to Outworld. 
All Sonya knew for sure was that she had to rescue her fellow agents. As her 
Special Forces training dictated, no man would be left behind.<hr color="#1A1A1A">

Kano had been defeated in a battle with Special Forces agent Sonya Blade during 
Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm. Shao Kahn incarcerated him for this failure, 
but later hastily promoted him to General when he prevented the Emperor's 
assassination at the hands of the Shokan warrior known as Sheeva. Kano has 
remained in Outworld ever since. When the two sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi 
confronted Shao Kahn in a surprise attack, Kano decided not to help his emperor 
and remained hidden in the shadows to ally with the winning side. Once Shao Kahn 
was defeated, Kano offered his allegiance to the Deadly Alliance.<hr color="#1A1A1A">

The sorcerer Shang Tsung was imprisoned in the depths of Shao Kahn's fortress, 
punished for failing to win the Mortal Kombat tournament in Earthrealm. 
Periodically he was released to perform tasks for the emperor, until he 
eventually regained Shao Kahn's favor and was given his freedom. He remained in 
Outworld risking his life to drain the souls of kombatants in order to sustain 
his youth. All this changed the day the sorcerer Quan Chi returned from the 
Netherrealm. Quan Chi proposed an alliance between the two sorcerers that would 
prove to be mutually beneficial. He offered Shang Tsung access to unlimited 
souls through a portal linked to the heavens in return for his assistance in 
transplanting warrior souls into the mummified remains of the Dragon King's 
undefeatable army. Shang Tsung accepted the offer and the Deadly Alliance was 
formed.<hr color="#1A1A1A">
