<b>Bio:</b><br>
During the years that Shang Tsung sponsored the Mortal Kombat tournaments on earth, 
the Outworld master Bo' Rai Cho was secretly training warriors for competition. 
It was even speculated that it was he who brought the fighting style of Drunken 
Boxing to Earthrealm. After many years, he finally discovered the Shaolin monk Liu 
Kang and taught him the martial arts moves he needed to defeat Shang Tsung. Later, 
with the tournament securely in the hands of the Shaolin, his teachings were no 
longer needed and he returned to Outworld.<br>
Bo' Rai Cho had been unable to compete against Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat 
tournament on Earth, his Outworld birthplace guaranteed that his victory would have 
been in the name of Shao Kahn. But the conflict this time was not a tournament to 
prevent an evil emperor from consuming another realm. The time the battle was to 
save his own realm from the tyranny of two evil sorcerers. Nothing could hold him 
back from the challenge that lay before him. The wrath of Bo' Rai Cho would be unleashed 
once again.<hr class="sub">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Johnny Cage had been fed up with the lame writing on his current movie &quot;Mortal 
Kombat: The Death of Johnny Cage&quot;, in which his character repeatedly died and 
was resurrected. To him, his real-life adventures were much more sensational - he 
kicked butt! But his studio felt that the hero needed to take a fall for dramatic 
purposes, Johnny Cage reluctantly agreed to continue with the project until the 
Thunder God Raiden called him away to a new adventure in Outworld.<br>
For maximum dramatic effect, Johnny Cage arrived on the island fortress of Shang 
Tsung by way of parachute. He glided to the exact place on the beach where Raiden 
had told him to rendezvous with the others. When night fell, the Earthrealm kombatants 
lit a fire and discussed possible strategies to defeat the Outworld threat. Once 
the fire had reached its full strength, Raiden finally appeared and revealed to 
them the events that had led to the formation of the Deadly Alliance.<hr class="sub">

Styles: Xing Yi, Aikido<br>

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Kano had been defeated in a battle with Special Forces agent Sonya Blade during 
Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm. Shao Kahn incarcerated Kano for his failure, 
but later hastily promoted him to General when he prevented the Emperor's assassination 
at the hands of the Shokan warrior known as Sheeva. With the merging of Earthrealm 
and Outworld not yet complete, Shao Kahn ordered Kano to portal back to the last 
remnants of Outworld to gather more troops for the final push against the Earthrealm 
opposition.<br>
Kano had remained in Outworld and served as General of Shao Kahn's military after 
the retreat from Earthrealm. For years he enjoyed the power of commanding the greatest 
army in Outworld. But Shao Kahn's power was fading and there was a chance that Kitana's 
forces might spell the Emperor's undoing. When the sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan 
Chi confronted Shao Kahn in a surprise attack, Kano decided not to interfere and 
remained hidden in the shadows to ally with the winning side. Once Shao Kahn was 
defeated, Kano offered his allegiance to the Deadly Alliance.<hr class="sub">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Sensing the cries of his captured ancestors, Kenshi made a vow to slay Shang Tsung 
in order to free them from his grasp. When he learned of Shang Tsung's escape to 
Outworld, Kenshi agreed to help the Special Forces search for the missing agent 
Cyrax as a means of gaining access to that realm, which allowed him to act as both 
rescue party and spy. Shortly after discovering the sorcerer's whereabouts, the 
Agency was destroyed and with it his only means for a return to Earth. Kenshi now 
finds himself facing the Deadly Alliance on his own.<br>
Years ago, the rogue swordsman Kenshi wandered Japan to challenge the greatest warriors. 
His purpose in life was simply to be the best. Shang Tsung, however, had discovered 
Kenshi's true heritage as a descendant of a long forgotten line of warrior kings. 
The sorcerer desired to consume the souls of those warrior kings and tricked the 
unknowing Kenshi into releasing them from their tomb, an act which left him blinded. 
Shang Tsung consumed the souls and left Kenshi to die in the tomb.<hr class="sub">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
Kung Lao was the first to find the body of his friend and fellow Shaolin Monk Liu 
Kang. He later discovered that it was in fact Shang Tsung who had dealt the fatal 
blow. Enraged, Kung Lao abandoned his Shaolin beliefs and vowed revenge against 
the sorcerer. He knew that his fighting skill would not be sufficient to best Shang 
Tsung. He would need training from the same Outworld master who had taught Liu Kang 
the one special attack he needed to win the Mortal Kombat tournament so many years 
ago.<br>
Kung Lao traveled to Outworld and informed the martial arts master, Bo' Rai Cho, 
of Liu Kang's death at the hands of the sorcerer Shang Tsung. Devastated by the 
news, the old master agreed to teach Kung Lao the flying kick Liu Kang had used 
to defeat Shang Tsung a decade ago. The training was intense, but Bo' Rai Cho was 
determined to give Kung Lao a greater edge than he had given Liu Kang. Once Kung 
Lao had mastered the &quot;whirlwind Kick&quot;, both he and Bo' Rai Cho journeyed 
across Outworld to deal with the sorcerer Shang Tsung.<hr class="sub">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
The Deadly Alliance commanded Kano and his troops to force a small population of 
people to construct a palace fortress. One of those enslaved was Li Mei, who rebelled 
against the invaders and attacked Kano himself. Recognizing the warrior spirit she 
possessed, the sorcerer Quan Chi offered to free her people if she could win the 
Deadly Alliance Tournament. If she did not win, however, she would be forced to 
serve the Alliance and her people would remain slaves forever. Li Mei had no choice 
but to accept the offer.<br>
During the construction of Shang Tsung's palace, Li Mei discovered that it would 
be constructed around the ancient stone structure located on a nearby plateau. Her 
people have regarded the relic as sacred for as long as anyone could remember. Legends 
told that it was a portal to the heavens left behind by the gods themselves. When 
Quan Chi activated the portal with his mysterious amulet and countless souls spewed 
forth, trapped between the realms, it was clear that the legends had been true.<hr class="sub">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
The Red Dragon had existed for centuries as a secretive criminal organization. members 
such as Mavado were highly skilled and disciplined warriors. But in the last century, 
many of the more reckless members became dissatisfied with the restraints the code 
of the Red Dragon placed on them and broke away to form their own gang. Since then, 
it has been the Red Dragon's number one priority to completely eradicate the infidels 
known collectively as the Black Dragon.<br>
It was thought that the Black Dragon had been completely destroyed until Mavado 
was approached by the two sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi. The sorcerers offered 
to hand over the last member of the Black Dragon, Kano, in return for Mavado's assistance 
in eliminating a spy in Outworld. Mavado accepted the offer and traveled to Outworld 
with Quan Chi and Shang Tsung by way of a secret inter-realm portal located in the 
Lost Sea. The swordsman who had been spying on Shang Tsung for the past few months 
would soon be eliminated.<hr class="sub">

Stranded in The Netherrealm, Quan Chi was persistently tormented by the ninja specter 
Scorpion. But with assistance from Moloch and Drahmin, Quan Chi discovered the truth 
about the amulet he had stolen from the fallen Elder God Shinnok. An ancient Rune 
Stone bearing the likeness of his amulet revealed new information that would enable 
Quan Chi to traverse the realms through a network of ancient gateways. Narrowly 
evading Scorpion's wrath, he escaped The Netherrealm through one of these gateways 
and emerged in an ancient tomb in Outworld.<br>
Quan Chi had stumbled upon the ancient mummified army of the long-forgotten Dragon 
King. Writings on the King's sarcophagus had revealed that the army was invincible 
and that it could be revived. Quan Chi struck a deal with the sorcerer Shang Tsung 
to resuscitate the army in return for the constant supply of souls his amulet could 
unlock from a gateway to the Heavens. Before any alliance between the two could 
succeed, however, their two strongest opponents would have to be eliminated.<hr class="sub">

<b>Bio:</b><br>
The ninja Scorpion had assumed for many years that Sub-Zero killed his family and 
clan, only to later discover that the true murderer was the sorcerer Quan Chi. After 
revealing his treachery, Quan Chi then attempted to send Scorpion to the 5th plane 
of the Netherrealm. Thinking quickly, Scorpion grappled with the sorcerer at the 
last moment and they were both transported to that forbidden realm. This turn of 
events boded well for Scorpion as his strength increased the longer he remained 
there. Quan Chi's powers, however, proved to be useless against him.<br>
Scorpion hunted Quan Chi relentlessly throughout the Netherrealm, thrashing him 
every chance he could. Eventually, Quan Chi enlisted the help of two Oni to protect 
him from the onslaught. When Quan Chi finally discovered a way out of the Netherrealm 
through a strange portal, Scorpion rushed to follow him. He emerged in Outworld 
but in a different location, far from his prey. He can still sense Quan Chi's presence 
and will hunt him wherever he runs to. There is nowhere the sorcerer can hide.<hr class="sub">

The sorcerer Shang Tsung was imprisoned in the depths of Shao Kahn's fortress, punished 
for failing to win the Mortal Kombat tournament in Earthrealm. Periodically he was 
released to perform tasks for the emperor, until he eventually regained Shao Kahn's 
favor and was given his freedom. he remained in Outworld risking his life to drain 
the souls of kombatants in order to sustain his youth. All this changed the day 
the sorcerer Quan Chi returned from the Netherrealm.<br>
Quan Chi proposed an alliance with Shang Tsung that would prove to be mutually beneficial. 
He offered Shang Tsung immortality by unlocking a portal linked to the Heavens. 
Shang Tsung would therefore have access to an unlimited number of souls to preserve 
his youth. In return, all Quan Chi required was Shang Tsung's assistance in transplanting 
warrior souls into the mummified remains of the Dragon King's undefeatable army. 
Shang Tsung accepted the offer and the Deadly Alliance was formed.<hr class="sub">

Agent Sonya Blade and her team had finished their mission of demolishing any known 
ancient inter-realm portals when she received word from Jax that the Agency's portal 
chamber had been destroyed. With no means for traversing the realms, Sonya realized 
that there were now two agents lost in Outworld. The first was the ninjas cyborg 
Cyrax, whom the agency had lost contact with some time ago. And now agent Kenshi, 
originally sent to find Cyrax, was lost as well. She would have to find a way to 
get to Outworld and bring them home.<br>
Sonya was instructed to accompany Jax to an island in the Lost Sea where the Thunder 
God Raiden would meet them. The island had once been the location of her first Mortal 
Kombat tournament a decade ago. Now it was an abandoned reminder of the struggle 
between Earthrealm and the forces of evil. As she and the other heroes waited for 
Raiden to appear, she came to the realization that this time she had no plan of 
attack. All Sonya knew for sure was that somehow she had to rescue her fellow agents. 
As her Special Forces training dictated, no man would be left behind.<hr class="sub">

The future of the Lin Kuei hung in the balance as Sub-Zero and the ninja cyborg

then claimed the title of Grand Master. With his freezing powers enhanced by the 
medallion, he vowed to reform the Lin Kuei as a force for good. Sub-Zero relocated 
the clan to a remote location in the frozen Artic where he had discovered an ancient 
temple frozen in the side of a glacier. There, the new Lin Kuei could hone their 
skills without interruption.<br>
Raiden appeared before Sub-Zero and asked for his aid in defeating the Deadly Alliance 
in Outworld. Fighting alongside Raiden would prove to the world that the Lin Kuei 
had changed for the better, Sub-Zero accepted the challenge and brought with him 
one of his newest recruits. It was highly unusual for the Grand Master to embark 
on such a dangerous mission, but Sub-Zero felt it was necessary to earn the respect

his last transport to that realm, a reptilian creature ambushed Cyrax. His arm console 
was damaged in the struggle and with it his Inter-realm portal technology. He defeated 
the creature, but will have to find some other means to return to Earthrealm.<br>
A vampire woman named Nitara offered Cyrax a deal to return him to Earthrealm if 
he retrieved for her an object from the molten depths of Outworld. His cybernetic 
exterior was resistant to the harsh environment in which the object was hidden, 
but only for a short period of time. It was a risky proposition, but it was one 
that Cyrax was willing to take to return to Earth. Although he did not fully trust 
Nitara, he agreed to travel with her to the location of the mysterious object.<hr class="sub">

The Oni Tormenter Drahmin resided in the 5th plane of The Netherrealm for centuries. 
It was therefore no surprise to Moloch that Drahmin would so readily accept Quan 
Chi's offer of freedom from that realm in return for protection from the ninja specter 
Scorpion. Drahmin and Moloch savagely brutalized Scorpion whenever he made a move 
for Quan Chi. It would not be long before they would be released upon the world 
of the living and taste mortal flesh once more.<br>
Drahmin had led Quan Chi to a structure that housed the remnants of ancient tablets 
and runestones dating back to the creation of the realms. Quan Chi's eye was caught 
by a tablet with an image that bore a striking resemblance to his amulet. The engraved 
writing revealed the amulet's hidden power to control inter-realm portals. Breaking 
his promise, Quan Chi betrayed Moloch and Drahmin and used the amulet to escape 
The Netherrealm without them. Unknown to Quan Chi, however, the two Oni also escaped 
and are now thirsty for revenge.<hr class="sub">

Sub-Zero had reformed the Lin Kuei clan and held a tournament to recruit the best 
of the best. the winner was a mysterious female named Frost who seemed to have freezing 
abilities similar to those of Sub-Zero. Breaking with Lin Kuei tradition, the new 
Grand Master, Sub-Zero, took it upon himself to train this new recruit. With his 
help, Frost was able to better harness her Kori powers. Sub-Zero was not able to 
teach her humility, however, and her arrogance grew along with her superior fighting 
abilities.<br>
At request of the Thunder God Raiden, Sub-Zero journeyed to Outworld to help defeat 
the Deadly Alliance. Frost accompanied him to aid her new mentor and to gain more 
experience as a warrior. By participating in real-world battles, Sub-Zero had hoped 
that Frost would gain perspective and enlightenment. But unknown to Sub-Zero, Frost 
had other reasons for following him into Outworld. She was merely waiting for the 
right moment to reveal her true intentions.<hr class="sub">

A member of the Red Dragon, Hsu Hao's duty was to infiltrate the Special Forces 
and covertly guide them to members of the Black Dragon. Once the Black Dragon was 
seemingly destroyed, Hsu Hao was ordered to remain among the special forces ranks 
as an informant until further notice. That notice came when his superior Mavado, 
ordered him to destroy the Outerworld Investigation Agency's ability to travel to 
the Outworld. Hsu Hao would not dishonor his Red Dragon clan; he would complete 
his task at any cost.<br>
Hsu Hao gained access to an Ion Pulse bomb and infiltrated the heavily reinforced 
underground bunker that housed the techno-portals designed by the Agency. Barely 
evading Jax, Hsu Hao activated the portal to Outworld, switched on the bomb, and 
escaped into the portal before the Ion Pulse went off. The Agency was destroyed 
and with it any means for inter-realm travel from Earthrealm. Hsu Hao must now make 
contact with Mavado in Outworld to receive his next objective.<hr class="sub">

Jax spent most of his time in the heavily fortified underground facilities of the 
Outerworld Investigation Agency. From an enormous underground chamber, Jax would 
send his agents to the other realms by way of man-made inter-realm portals. Two 
of his agents, the cyborg ninja Cyrax and the rouge swordsman Kenshi, had been assigned 
to the realm of Outworld - a domain of strange creatures and maniacal sorcerers. 
Jax would soon be reminded of just how dangerous a threat to Earth that realm could 
be.<br>
After receiving information from Agent Kenshi about a new threat from Outworld, 
Jax barely escaped with his life when a traitor destroyed all means for inter-realm 
travel. The Outerworld Investigation Agency was completely obliterated. But with 
the help of the Thunder God Raiden, Jax eventually made it to Outworld to deal with 
the traitor who now served the Deadly Alliance. Jax swore that he would show no 
mercy to the one responsible for the destruction. The hunt for Hsu Hao had begun.<hr class="sub">

Having freed her home world of Edenia from Shao Kahn's grasp, Kitana led her people 
to battle against the weakened Emperor in a pre-emptive strike. She allied with 
the Shokan armies of Outworld, led by Prince Goro, and together their two nations 
were on the brink of victory. Tragedy struck when Goro was killed in battle and 
the Shokan army spiraled into leaderless chaos. But in a strange turn of events, 
Shao Kahn was slain by unknown assailants and Kano's troops began a hasty retreat. 
Kitana had one, but at a terrible cost to the Shokan people.<br>
The last of the Emperor Shao Kahn's armies had retreated and it seemed to Kitana 
that a new era of peace was at hand. But when a small number of hideous undead soldiers 
began to appear under the banner of the sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, her 
dreams of returning to the realm of Edenia would have to wait. Her army clashed 
with this new threat, but were easily cut down by the bewitched weapons that the 
undead wielded. The souls of her slain troops left their bodies and flew off into

The vampire Nitara had at long last discovered the location of the Orb that bound 
her realm to Outworld. Unfortunately, it rested in a location that she could never 
access. However, the ninja cyborg Cyrax of Earthrealm had the ability to retrieve 
it for her. Through careful manipulation, she convinced Reptile to engage Cyrax 
in combat and destroy his arm panel in the process. The damage to his transporter 
left him stranded in Outworld. Her plan was coming together beautifully.<br>
Nitara offered to send Cyrax back to Earthrealm if he could retrieve the Orb from 
its hiding place. Nitara carried a gemstone around her neck. These gemstones made 
it possible for her people to traverse the realms. They had done so for ages and 
had even visited Earthrealm regularly in search of blood. Cyrax had no choice but 
to accept the offer and journeyed with her to the presumed location of the Orb. 
As they traveled across Outworld, however, they had the strange feeling that they 
were being followed.<hr class="sub">

The Elder Gods were fully aware of the potential damage the alliance between Quan 
Chi and Shang Tsung posed to the stability of the realms. Yet even with this foresight, 
they all stood firm on their decision not to interfere. All, that is, except for 
one - Raiden. The former God of Thunder pleaded with his fellow Elder Gods to take 
action, but they refused. Disgusted, Raiden relinquished his Elder God status and 
returned to Earthrealm to gather support against the coming storm.<br>
Raiden returned to Earthrealm to reunite with his comrades and inform them of the 
impending threat from the Deadly Alliance. Those that accepted his call to arms 
were instructed to meet him on Shang Tsung's old island fortress, located in the 
Lost Sea. Once there, Raiden explained in detail the dire situation that faced not 
only Outworld, but Earthrealm as well. He then summoned Shang Tsung's Nethership 
from the ocean depths and with it transported them all to a celestial portal known 
only to sorcerers and deities. They emerged in Outworld ready for battle.<hr class="sub">

Reptile had discovered the plot devised by Shang Tsung and Quan Chi to assassinate 
Shao Kahn, but on his way to inform his master, he was distracted by a vampire woman 
named Nitara. She led him to the hidden base camp of Kitana's fortress. Knowing 
the location of the base would be a great help to the Emperor in the war against 
Edenia and the Shokan. Eager to relay all that he had learned, Reptile raced back 
to Shao Kahn's fortress, only to discover him lying dead on the throne room floor.<br>
Reptile's detour to Kitana's base camp had delayed him just long enough for Shang 
Tsung and Quan Chi to spring their attack on Shao Kahn. Reptile was devastated that 
he had failed his master and wandered the Outworld wastelands aimlessly until he 
once again crossed paths with Nitara. Desperately in need of a master, he offered 
his loyalty to her. Her first command to him was to attack the invader from Earthrealm, 
Cyrax. She explained that he must first destroy his arm panel in order to weaken 
the outsider.<hr class="sub">
