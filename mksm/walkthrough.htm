<img src="maps/1.jpg" width="500" height="236" title="Goro's Lair" border="0" alt="Goro's Lair"><br>
<br>
Grab a blue koin from the center of the starting room and kill a group of Oni 
that run out to attack.<br>
<br>
Collect 2 more blue koins to receive more tips and generate more Oni. Slay all 
Oni to make the gate open.<br>
<br>
Enter the next room and block one of the Oni's attacks.<br>
<br>
Destroy that Oni and collect more blue koins.<br>
<br>
Enter the next room at the bottom of the pit.<br>
<br>
Kill the Oni and jump up the ledge on the other side.<br>
<br>
Follow the ledge around, jump up, and run across a wall. Notice the moon behind 
you.<br>
<br>
Jump across ledges to the top of the room and find a bridge.<br>
<br>
Run across the bridge.<br>
<br>
Exit the room and you'll find yourself in Goro's chandelier room. Grab the red 
koin to gain the ability to perform fatalities.<br>
<br>
Fill up your fatality meter by performing combos on the Oni, and then finish him 
off with a Fatality.<br>
<br>
When all Oni are defeated, move to the next room. To pass this room, you must 
throw an Oni into the far wall. Follow the hole out.<br>
<br>
You're now outside in another pit area. Save your game at the glowing statue.<br>
<br>
The long bridge collapses. Drop down into the collapsed section, grabbing a 
sword on a pedestal. At the base, fight several Oni, including a huge Oni 
Warlord.<br>
<br>
After defeating the Warlord, grab the koin and receive the ability to perform 
Long Jumps.<br>
<br>
Jump up the platforms. Long jump back to the save point, and then long jump 
across the broken section of the bridge.<br>
<br>
Go across a small bridge with a waterfall behind it. Defeat a pair of Masked 
Guards.<br>
<br>
After defeating the Masked Guards, a portal opens. Take it, and you're 
teleported to the Wu Shi Academy.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="2"></a><u><b>Wu Shi Academy:</b></u><br>
<img src="maps/2.jpg" title="Wu Shi Academy" border="0" alt="Wu Shi Academy" width="500" height="254"><br>
<br>
Move Forward and kill several Tarkatans.<br>
<br>
When the path forks, go right, onto a wooden bridge. A catapult stone flies in, 
destroying the bridge. Keep running to avoid damage.<br>
<br>
Jump across a barrier to a spot with the two catapults. Kill the Tarkatan here.<br>
<br>
Jump up some stone steps, avoiding a flame jet. Turn right and throw a Tarkata 
into a pile of rocks. The rocks tumble down, clearing an obstacle below.<br>
<br>
Go back down the steps and proceed right.<br>
<br>
There is a lone catapult as you walk to your right. Knock an enemy into the 
catapult. This smashes a barrier back near the rock pile you tumbled earlier. Go 
back to the steps with the Flame Jet, climb them, go left, and throw an enemy 
into the spiked balls to destroy a barricade up ahead.<br>
<br>
Go back down the steps and head right. Jump across a series of platforms with 
flame jets. Always jump to the next platform just as the flame die down.<br>
<br>
Defeat a Masked Guard near a wall, then jump up unto the wall.<br>
<br>
Follow the wall to the first academy building.<br>
<br>
Drop down into the courtyard and help Johnny Cage defeat several Tarkata.<br>
<br>
Johnny will lead you to another courtyard. Fight the Tarkatans while Johnny 
opens a gate.<br>
<br>
Jump up a gap in the wall, and run along the wall. Watch out for Spiked 
Boulders.<br>
<br>
You meet up with Johnny again. Fight the Tarkata while he tries to open another 
route.<br>
<br>
Backtrack along the wall and drop back into the courtyard with Johnny. Defeat 
more Tarkata, then a door opens to your right.<br>
<br>
Take the door back to the first courtyard. A gate has dropped. Revealing a green 
koin and a sword. The green Koin is Health Upgrade #1. Grab the koin and the 
sword, and go back to the courtyard with Johnny.<br>
<br>
Run toward the camera and find a pond. Behind the pond are stone steps. Jump up 
these steps to a wall with flaming cauldrons. Use the sword to cut the ropes 
holding up the cauldrons.<br>
<br>
Drop back down.<br>
<br>
Take the path that leads beneath a Japanese style arch. Drop down some stone 
steps and go right, past three fire-spouting statues.<br>
<br>
You now enter the second Academy building, which is on fire. Jump across fires 
in the courtyard until you reach a Test Your Might switch.<br>
<br>
Activate the switch. This releases water, extinguishing the fire on a nearby 
rooftop.<br>
<br>
Jump onto that rooftop, and up to the wall behind it. Go left and enter the 
tower. Activate the second Test Your Might switch there.<br>
<br>
Go right along the wall. Enter a tower and activate the third Test Your Might 
switch.<br>
<br>
Go right again. A stone statue (which you cannot destroy yet) blocks your path, 
but you can move toward the camera, dropping onto a lower wall. Follow the wall 
to the fourth Test Your Might switch, and activate it.<br>
<br>
Keep going right, following the wall. You reach some roof tops overlooking the 
courtyard where you entered. Jump across the roofs to a high tower, and activate 
the fifth and final Test Your Might switch.<br>
<br>
Exit the Academy building. Go back past the three fire-spouting statues. You'll 
see a spot where you can drop down, near a spiked wall.<br>
<br>
Drop down next to the spiked wall and follow the path. Avoid the swinging logs.<br>
<br>
Fight Masked Guards near a catapult. When you defeat them, a path is cleared. 
Follow the path.<br>
<br>
The path leads to a save point and a swirling portal. Save your game and then 
jump in.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="3"></a><u><b>The Portal:</b></u><br>
<img src="maps/3.jpg" title="Evil Monastry" border="0" alt="Evil Monastry" width="500" height="254"><br>
<br>
You are now in the Portal area. It is basically a hub between all the other 
realms. (I'll get a map up here sometime in the future)<br>
<br>
From the portal, you must make your way to the Evil Monastery.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="4"></a><u><b>The Evil Monastery:</b></u><br>
<br>
You appear at the base of the Monastery steps. Go up the steps into the huge 
building.<br>
<br>
From the ground floor, run to the second floor and activate the Test Your Might 
switch. Notice the 2 spikes that emerge.<br>
<br>
Go back down to the ground floor and launch enemies into the spikes. After you 
impale an enemy onto both spikes, a door opens on the top level.<br>
<br>
Run upstairs and take the exit that opened. Keep going until you reach a 
courtyard with spikes on the far wall.<br>
<br>
Knock an enemy into the spikes, and jump from them to the level above you. Then 
proceed to run to the exit.<br>
<br>
You enter a room with a giant statue with spiked claws.<br>
<br>
Run upstairs to exit the room.<br>
<br>
The next room should look familiar. This room requires you to learn a new 
technique - The Multality! Perform a Multality to drop the gate and to continue 
onward.<br>
<br>
Go past the Fist of Ruin statues guarding the gateway and start climbing the 
tower. You have to long jump across spike pits as you go along.<br>
<br>
There are 3 spots where gates will block your progress. Each time you're 
stopped, destroy all enemies to continue.<br>
<br>
Avoid a rolling column and save your game at the save point.<br>
<br>
Make your way to the roof. You will encounter Kitana here.<br>
<img src="mksm_kitana.jpg" title="Kitana" border="1" alt="Kitana" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
Fight Kitana. Use distance attacks and launch attacks for effective results.<br>
<br>
After Kitana is damaged to a point, she will run through a gateway. You will 
follow her automatically.<br>
<br>
<b>Bosses:</b> Kitana, Mileena, and Jade<br>
<img src="mksm_kitana.jpg" title="Kitana" border="1" alt="Kitana" width="75" height="75"><img src="mksm_mileena.jpg" title="Mileena" border="1" alt="Mileena" width="75" height="75"><img src="mksm_jade.jpg" title="Jade" border="1" alt="Jade" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
After following Kitana through the gateway, Mileena and Jade show up. This is a 
tough battle, however there are a few tricks to help you. FOCUS ON KITANA. Use 
similar tactics that you used before.<br>
<br>
When you damage Kitana enough, she will automatically be thrown into a trap. She 
must stay in that trap for a total of about 1 minute. DO NOT LET JADE NOR 
MILEENA FREE KITANA. After the trap has freed Kitana's mind, you focus totally 
on Mileena and Jade. Use throws, power attacks, and launch attacks. Once one is 
out of energy, focus on the other. Once both are ready for fatalities, perform a 
fatality to the one you were last fighting. The end result is the same no matter 
who you perform the fatality on.<br>

<br>
After the fight is over, a koin appears on the dragon logo. Grab it to gain the 
Fist of Ruin ability.<br>
<br>
And don't forget to grab the Experience Koins either.<br>
<br>
Take the gateway back to the top of the monastery tower.<br>
<br>
Proceed back down the tower. Whenever a gate blocks your way, use the Fist of 
Ruin ability to destroy the evil statues and drop the gates.<br>
<br>
At the base of the tower, use your Fist of Ruin ability to destroy the statues 
that guard the gateway, and then enter the gateway to return to the portal.<br>
<br>
You will emerge on the lower level of the portal. Run up a ramp to your right.<br>
<br>
Approach the gateway to the Living Forest. It's guarded by a pair of Shadow 
Priests. Destroy both Priests to unlock the gateway. Then, Jump in.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="5"></a><u><b>The Living Forest:</b></u><br>
<img src="maps/4.jpg" title="Living Forest" border="0" alt="Living Forest" width="500" height="254"><br>
<br>
You emerge in the Living Forest. Run down the path and destroy the Evil Statue 
with your newly found Fist of Ruin.<br>
<br>
Throw or punch at least one Putrid Corpse into the tree and it will eat it. Kill 
the others as well.<br>
<br>
A wall of thorns in the back area drops away, revealing a save point. Save the 
game here.<br>
<br>
Move toward the camera until you come to a group of Brothers of the Shadow. 
Finish them all.<br>
<br>
After they fall, some thorns in the background drop revealing a doorway. Jump 
over the thorns and go through the doorway.<br>
<br>
Go left and jump across a small waterfall. Throw a corpse into the 2nd Living 
Tree to feed it.<br>
<br>
Go through the doorway next to the Living Tree. Move right and jump across the 
water.<br>
<br>
You find a sealed tomb with clay statues near it. Throw a clay statue through 
that tomb door to break it open. <a href="smoke_missions.htm">Smoke is inside</a>.<br>
<br>
After you get done talking with Smoke, keep going right, past the tomb entrance. 
Jump across the rocks. Do not hit the water unless you like huge snakes.<br>
<br>
When the reach the base of a tall waterfall, jump up the platforms until you 
reach the top. Enter the next area.<br>
<br>
You emerge in a clearing, surrounded by four giant snakes. Throw or punch Putrid 
Corpses into each snake, to sate it's hunger. A snake disappears when it has 
been fed. You may pass when all four snaked are gone.<br>
<br>
Keep moving right and save the game at a save point. Go up and notice a 3rd 
Living Tree. Feed this tree a Putrid Corpse. Now you have fed all three Living 
Trees, and a snake-head door opens. Go left and enter the snake-head door. This 
is the entrance to Reptile's dodefault.<br>
<br>
Inside Reptile's domain, you must stand in the center of the room. Two clay 
statues periodically slide back and forth. Destroy both statues at the same time 
to advance.<br>
<br>
Next, four statues appear. Destroy them as well.<br>
<br>
Finally, five statues appear. Once they are destroyed, a koin appears which will 
grant you the Brutality Ability.<br>
<br>
Corpses now appear. Beat them down until all three dots on your Fatality Meter 
are red, and then initiate and perform a Brutality.<br>
<br>
Exit on the right side of the sliding statues room. Run through a very long 
tunnel filled with breakable clay statues, and up a ramp into the heart of 
Reptile's dodefault.<br>
<br>
You're now in a chamber with a giant snake. Your goal is to destroy all four 
columns that support the ceiling. You'll do this by performing your Fist of Ruin 
technique on their weak points.<br>
<br>
Once you destroy the fourth column, the entire room collapses.<br>
<br>
You fall down into a cellar. Now it's finally time to fight Reptile.<br>
<br>
<b>Boss:</b> Reptile<br>
<img src="mksm_reptile.jpg" title="Reptile" border="1" alt="Reptile" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
Block Reptile's first attack (usually a sliding kick) and then hit him with 
strong attacks before he can recover. Follow this up with well-timed launch 
attacks to juggle him and deal serious damage.<br>
<br>
If Reptile raises a glowing fist in the air, jump away; he's about to do an area 
attack that will hurt you if you're anywhere close.<br>
<br>
If he creates a glowing ball of energy, be prepared to jump over the projectile.<br>
<br>
Every so often, Reptile will flee to a high perch and shoot explosive 
projectiles. Stand in one of the corners to avoid this attack.<br>
<br>
After you're damaged Reptile enough, he no longer goes up to the perch. The bad 
news; He's now going to turn mostly invisible.<br>
<br>
Stay in the air a lot during this stage of the fight.<br>
<br>
Use the targeting buttons to launch attacks at Reptile. It will help you detect 
him.<br>
<br>
Use juggle attacks and throws against him.<br>
<br>
When you've defeated Reptile, perform his fatality:<br>
<br>

<br>
When Reptile's finished, grab a koin from the floor. The koin grants you the 
Wall Climbing ability.<br>
<br>
Use the Fist of Ruin ability on the remains of the dead snake, and then jump 
onto the wall behind the snake. Wall Climb out of the cellar.<br>
<br>
Backtrack all the way to the start of the level, back through the gateway which 
will lead you back to The Portal.<br>
<br>
Back in the portal, locate a Climbing Wall on the lower level, and use your new 
wall climbing ability to get up the wall.<br>
<br>
Destroy some Shadow Priests at the top. A bridge appears. Take the bridge to the 
gateway, and jump in. You will be entering the Soul Tombs.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="6"></a><u><b>Soul Tombs:</b></u><br>
<img src="maps/5.jpg" title="Soul Tombs" border="0" alt="Soul Tombs" width="500" height="254"><br>
<br>
You emerge on a platform. To your right is an entry leading to the Soul Tomb's 
central hub.<br>
<br>
Enter the main hub and save your game.<br>
<br>
Go through the door with the red symbol.<br>
<br>
You emerge in the Iron Maiden room. Go left and exit through the door in the 
back wall. (Covered in spider webs)<br>
<br>
Fight a host of foes in the next room, then wall climb up a studded wall.<br>
<br>
Take the exit on the upper floor. You emerge in an outdoor area with walk ways 
going left, right, and forward. Run forward (towards the camera), jumping over 
the rippling lines of spikes.<br>
<br>
Activate the Test Your Might switch on the platform you reach. Activate the 
switch while the Masked Guard in the background is close to the left-most gate. 
This causes the gate to drop and smash the Masked Guard.<br>
<br>
Backtrack across the spikes, and go through the gate you just opened. There is a 
second Test Your Might switch here. Do the same thing with the Masked Guard near 
the opposite gate, dropping the gate and crushing him.<br>
<br>
Go through the second dropped gate, Jump across spikes, and reach a third Test 
Your Might switch. Again, time it so you activate the switch when a Masked Guard 
is close to the gate in the background.<br>
<br>
After the third gate is crushed, you're free to cross the entire area and leave 
through the other side.<br>
<br>
Make your way through the room with hooks on the ceiling. Uppercut a Tarkatan 
into the hooks for a gory death sequence. Then keep going.<br>
<br>
You should now be in a room with a spiked ceiling. Fight the enemies. Utilize 
the spikes for easy kills.<br>
<br>
There is a Test Your Might switch in this room. Successfully complete this 
challenge to open a door elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Backtrack all the way to the Iron Maiden room. Go through the door on the very 
left side of the room.<br>
<br>
Fight a host of more enemies in the next room and be cautious of the Flaming 
Floor!<br>
<br>
The next room contains some Tarkata and an Orochi Hellbeast. Get rid of the 
Tarkata first. With the Tarkata gone, use Aerial Attacks and projectile attacks, 
or just go into Brutality mode.<br>
<br>
When the Hellbeast is dead, backtrack all the way to the central hub (where the 
save point is) and then save your game.<br>
<br>
Go through the door with the green icon over it.<br>
<br>
Make your way into a room with a spiked ceiling. You must destroy all the 
Tarkatans here before the next door will open.<br>
<br>
Proceed into a long hall with moving chains in the background and foreground. Go 
to your right.<br>
<br>
You should now appear in a long, open area where lots of stuff is being shot and 
thrown at you. Platform your way across this area, dodging projectiles. (I use 
the Long Jump at this point and rarely get hit at all, but it takes practice.) 
Go through the next door.<br>
<br>
You are now in the Spinning Fan room. Launch the Tarkata into the fan and keep 
moving.<br>
<br>
In the next room, you are faced with a group of Tarkata. Knock one of them into 
the ceiling up against the back of the room.<br>
<br>
Jump onto the collapsed ceiling section, and from there jump to the upper level. 
Take the exit up here.<br>
<br>
You are now above the Giant Fan. Jump onto the platform above the fan. When 
Tarkata attack, launch them into the fan blades.<br>
<br>
After a few Tarkata have hit the fan, a fan-blade will shoot into the side of 
the wall. Use this stuck fan-blade to climb to the ledge above it. Run to the 
room with the plate on the floor. Stand on the plate to make a sword drop 
elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Backtrack all the way back to the room with the moving chains. At the left-most 
edge of this room, find the sword you saw drop earlier.<br>
<br>
Grab the sword and slice the two chained prisoners flanking the door to the 
left. When both prisoners have been disemboweled, the door opens.<br>
<br>
You are now in the Soul Collector room. Destroy a host of enemies, and then 
repeatedly use Fist of Ruin on the glowing green soul collector. Eventually the 
device explodes.<br>
<br>
Backtrack all the way to the level hub. Save the game once again. Then, take the 
new doorway that has opened on the eastern edge of the room. This leads you to 
Baraka.<br>
<br>
<b>Boss:</b> Baraka<br>
<img src="mksm_baraka.jpg" title="Baraka" border="1" alt="Baraka" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
The first fight starts with a typical melee attack. Many of Baraka's attacks can 
be blocked, so you can try a block-counterattack style of fighting. Just be 
aware that Baraka has a head-stab move that cannot be blocked, so it pays to 
keep on the move and jump away if it looks like he's going to start that attack. 
As with many tough foes, the best policy is to hit Baraka constantly so he 
doesn't get a chance to counterattack. Use long kombos or series of launch 
attacks keep him airborne and helpless.<br>
<br>
Next Baraka throws some flaming monks at you. Finish off the monks with 
projectile attacks, (ie fireballs or hat throw.) before they run into you. This 
will get you a little health. Then go back to pounding on Baraka.<br>
<br>
Next Baraka jumps into the background and starts hurling projectiles. Dodge 
these, and shoot with your own projectiles. He is most vulnerable when he is in 
the middle of the screen. After he's shot at you from one die or the other, get 
ready for him to move to the middle, and make sure some of your projectiles are 
there to meet him.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Baraka returns to your area. Two green swords are knocked to the 
floor. Grab one of these swords and slice Baraka. (multiple weak attacks seem to 
work the best: jump away and try again later if Baraka seems to be blocking your 
strikes.) Another good strategy is to slice Baraka right after he attempts an 
attack-he is vulnerable when returning to his normal stance. Don't try to stand 
close and keep moving during this phase of the fight, or you'll get hit with a 
nasty impale move that will make you drop your sword.<br>
<br>
After slashing Baraka enough, a test your might challenge comes up. Win and 
knock Baraka back on his heels.<br>
<br>
After winning the test your might challenge, press the throw button to throw 
your sword into Baraka, impaling him. The blade either sticks out of his head or 
body.<br>
<br>
Now repeat the process with the second sword: slash Baraka, get to the test your 
might challenge, then impale him with the second blade. At this point you can 
perform the fatality listed here below and finish off Baraka.<br>

<br>
With Baraka gone, a koin appears on a tall pedestal. But you cannot get to the 
top of the pedestal yet!<br>
<br>
Instead, go through a gateway to that leads back to the Wu Shi Academy.<br>
<br>
Back at the Wu Shi Academy - jump on roofs to reach the wall. Run along the wall 
until you find an Evil Statue. Destroy it using your Fist of Ruin ability.<br>
<br>
Run past the destroyed statue and drop down into a hidden courtyard. Grab a koin 
here. This koin grants you wall running ability.<br>
<br>
Wall run back up to the top of the academy wall. Return to the gateway that 
leads back to the Soul Tombs, and take it.<br>
<br>
Back at the Soul Tombs - now you can wall run up the pedestal, and grab the koin 
you won by defeating Baraka. This koin grants you the Wall Jump ability.<br>
<br>
Go all the way back to the Soul Tombs' central hub, and save the game if you 
like. From here, climb the stairs and take the gateway that leads back to the 
portal.<br>
<br>
Back at The Portal - drop down the big climbing wall. You're now on The Portal's 
lowest level. Go left. At the end of a walkway is a gateway. Go through it.<br>
<br>
You emerge in a different part of The Portal. The main feature in this area is a 
huge pair of doors with Chinese characters inscribed above them.<br>
<br>
To the right of the locked doors are two sets of Jumping Walls. Use the Wall 
Jump ability to climb both walls.<br>
<br>
At the top of this area, on the right, is a gateway to The Wasteland. You must 
destroy all enemies up here to make a path to the gateway appear. Do so, and 
move through the gateway.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="7"></a><u><b>The Wasteland:</b></u><br>
<img src="maps/6.jpg" title="Wasteland" border="0" alt="Wasteland" width="500" height="254"><br>
<br>
The Wasteland isn't as empty as its name suggests. You'll meet some interesting 
characters here - and for once, not everyone is an enemy.<br>
<br>
Move ahead to a large chamber filled with mercenaries. There's a save point in 
the corner of the this room.<br>
<br>
Grab a sword from the floor down here. Then, look for a wall you can climb. It's 
fairly subtle, so look carefully.<br>
<br>
Climb up the wall. Upstairs, move right and jump across a gap.<br>
<br>
Run across a bridge. You find a doorway blocked with piled bodies. Hack the 
bodies apart with your sword to cleave a path.<br>
<br>
The next room contains a pool of blood with a lightning rod in the middle. Throw 
or punch two waves of Elemental Knights into the pool. If the lightning hits the 
pool while they're in there, they are destroyed.<br>
<br>
When all Elemental Knights are destroyed, use a Test Your Might wheel at the 
right side of the room. Then leave the way you came, back to the room with the 
save point.<br>
<br>
Drop down to the lower level of the save point room, and take the new doorway 
that has opened.<br>
<br>
In the next area you encounter Sub-Zero. Guess what? It's time to fight!<br>
<br>
<b>Boss:</b> Sub-Zero<br>
<img src="mksm_sub.jpg" title="Sub-Zero" border="1" alt="Sub-Zero" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
Sub-Zero is fairly tough. We recommend beating him almost exclusively with 
long-range attacks. There are stones in this area, which can be thrown at 
Sub-Zero, to supplement your usual ranged attacks.<br>
<br>
Sub-Zero periodically shoots an ice projectile. Try to jump or dodge it. If 
you're playing Ko-Op, and one player gets frozen, the other player should 
distract Sub-Zero to prevent him from attacking the frozen player.<br>
<br>
When Sub-Zero is at medium range, he often does an icy slide kick. Jumping is 
the best way to avoid the kick. Also, wait for Sub-Zero to attack, then 
counter-attack with a combo for satisfying results. Maintain your distance, and 
keep firing. Eventually you'll win the battle.<br>
<br>
When you defeat Sub-Zero, he agrees to help you. He uses his ice powers to fix 
the holes in a leaky boat.<br>
<br>
You now take a long boat ride with Sub-Zero. Bloody skeletons climb onto the 
boat as it moves forward. Keep beating them down.<br>
<br>
Watch out for flame jets that spurt from the side walls. They'll roast you if 
you get too preoccupied with the skeletons.<br>
<br>
Eventually the boat reaches a dock. Get out, and approach a large building.<br>
<br>
Sub-Zero freezes the front door. Use your Fist of Ruin to bash the door, 
shattering it. The action now moves inside.<br>
<br>
Start throwing Mercenaries into a huge, spiked wheel.<br>
<br>
When enough Mercenaries have been thrown into the wheel, Sub-Zero freezes the 
blood waterfall. Wall climb up the waterfall.<br>
<br>
Take the exit up here. You emerge in a big open area. Move to the right, and 
protect Sub-Zero while he tries to make an ice path across a pit.<br>
<br>
If Sub-Zero gets knocked into the pit, jump down and kill all the Mercenaries. 
Then follow him out, and protect him again.<br>
<br>
When Sub-Zero finishes the ice path, diagonally wall run across it. You reach a 
save point.<br>
<br>
Scorpion will appear and confront Sub-Zero. Sub-Zero follows after him and leave 
you on your own.<br>
<img src="mksm_sub.jpg" title="Sub-Zero" border="1" alt="Sub-Zero" width="75" height="75"><img src="mksm_scorpion.jpg" title="Scorpion" border="1" alt="Scorpion" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
Go through the door near the save point. You must now fight Goro.<br>
<br>
<b>Boss:</b> Goro<br>
<img src="mksm_goro.jpg" title="Goro" border="1" alt="Goro" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
Goro is tough but predictable. Just what you'd expect from a four-armed brute. 
Fighting him up-close is a bad idea. You cannot block most of his attacks. 
Either use your projectile attacks or Dodge Goro's attacks long enough to jump 
in and get a few hits in before retreating fast. You can block Goro's projectile 
attacks. Sometimes if you fight up close you will activate a Test Your Might 
challenge. If you win this, you will temporarily stun Goro and get the chance to 
get a few hits in. After Goro is hurt considerably, he will pick up a huge 
column and use it as a baseball bat type weapon. This will extend his punching 
range and make him even more difficult to deal with. If Goro holds the pillar up 
above his head, it means that he's going to smash the floor with it. Jump before 
the pillar hits the floor. Eventually you'll deal enough damage to perform a 
Fatality on Goro...<br>
<br>
<b>Goro Fatality:</b>

<b>1</b><br>
<br>
Grab the koin that appears over Goro's body. This koin grants you the extremely 
useful ability - Double Jump. Leave the arena.<br>
<br>
Save the game at the save point. Then, move back to the left, long jumping over 
the pit with Sub-Zero's ice wall above it.<br>
<br>
On the extreme left of this area, notice that a gateway has appeared. Jump into 
the gateway.<br>
<br>
You will appear in the Dead Pool, a long room with acid pits on each side, and 
hooks overhead. Throw or launch an enemy onto each of the five hooks.<br>
<br>
When all the five hooks are filled, a koin appears. Grab it to receive the Pole 
Swing ability.<br>
<br>
Go left and Pole Swing your way into a gateway to return to the Portal.<br>
<br>
Back at the Portal - Now you're back at the new area of the portal - the one 
with the Chinese characters on the door. Drop down and go to that door (which 
you still can't open.)<br>
<br>
To the left of the big door is a set of poles. Pole Swing up to the top, and 
destroy all foes up there. This opens a path to the NetherRealm. Jump inside.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="8"></a><u><b>NetherRealm:</b></u><br>
<img src="maps/7.jpg" title="Netherrealm" border="0" alt="Netherrealm" width="500" height="254"><br>
<br>
The NetherRealm is not a big area, but it's definitely action-packed. Prepare 
yourself.<br>
<br>
You start out near a save point. Save the game and take some stairs leading 
down.<br>
<br>
You briefly encounter... Noob Saibot being chased by Sub-Zero...<br>
<img src="mksm_noob.jpg" title="Noob Saibot" border="1" width="75" height="75" alt="Noob Saibot"><img src="mksm_sub.jpg" title="Sub-Zero" border="1" alt="Sub-Zero" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
Keep going down. You encounter Scorpion, but he runs away. Keep moving.<br>
<br>
Eventually you reach a circular area where Scorpion decides to fight you. Start 
smacking him around.<br>
<br>
<b>Boss:</b> Scorpion/Inferno Scorpion<br>
<img src="mksm_scorpion.jpg" title="Scorpion" border="1" alt="Scorpion" width="75" height="75"><br>
<br>
Scorpion - Round 1: Scorpion has all his moves from MK2. Avoid the spear, and 
just let loose on him with power attacks and combos.<br>
<br>
After you've battered Scorpion, he breaks a hole in some rocks and retreats to a 
more advantageous spot. Follow him through the hole in the rocks.<br>
<br>
Jump to your left, across a series of high and low platforms. (If you fall to 
the lower level you can wall run back up to the top.)<br>
<br>
When you reach the end of the line, you must fight Scorpion again.<br>
<br>
Scorpion - Round 2: At the start of your second battle with Scorpion, he starts 
out atop a high perch. Whenever he raises his hands, flames jet up from the 
floor. Simply stand in place and watch the ground beneath your feet. When it 
starts to glow, double jump without moving sideways.<br>
<br>
Scorpion periodically fires his spear into the ground. Avoid standing close to 
the spear when it initially hits. Then, run up to it and grab it with the Throw 
button. This starts a Test Your Might challenge.<br>
<br>
If you succeed at the Test Your Might challenge, you yank Scorpion back down to 
your level. When Scorpion is down on your level, you can use the strategies you 
used during the first round of the fight.<br>
<br>
Keep this up until Scorpion's life disappears. Then initiate a fatality. Finish 
Scorpion off.<br>
<br>

<br>
Start moving away from the arena, and Scorpion reappears in another form - 
Inferno Scorpion.<br>
<br>
Inferno Scorpion: He likes to spin his spear in a deadly glistening arc that can 
hit you even at medium range. He also removes his mask to spit flames a short 
distance.<br>
<br>
Inferno Scorpion can also raise flames from the ground, scorching you if you 
aren't careful.<br>
<br>
Use techniques that you used on Scorpion in Round 1 until you finish him for 
good.<br>

<br>
Make your way back to the entrance of the NetherRealm, and take the gateway back 
to the Portal.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Return To Top</a><hr color="#333333">
<a name="9"></a><u><b>The Foundry:</b></u><br>
<img src="maps/8.jpg" title="Foundry" border="0" alt="Foundry" width="500" height="254"><br>
<br>
You appear back at the Portal. Drop all the way down to the door with the 
Chinese characters. It should now be open. Run through it and take the gateway 
to the Foundry.<br>
<br>
The Foundry is a fiery weapons factory where Shao Kahn's arsenal is forged. It's 
also the place where you'll meet the toughest challenge of the game.<br>
<br>
Run into the Foundry's central hub. There's a save point here; we recommend 
saving your progress.<br>
<br>
Take a tunnel just to the right of the save point. At the end of that tunnel, 
complete a Test Your Might challenge. Then run back to the save point.<br>
<br>
There's a ramp to the left of the save point. Take it upstairs, then go left, 
through a hall filled with crushers.<br>
<br>
Beat the Test Your Might challenge at the end of the crusher hallway.<br>
<br>
Return to the save point, and go through the tunnel just to the left of it. 
(Move away from the camera.)<br>
<br>
You emerge in the cauldron room. Lava boils on the floor to your right, and 
cauldrons slide on rails overhead. Jump diagonally to your right, across a 
couple of platforms in the lava. Exit the door on the right.<br>
<br>
The next room features a fireplace in the background. Keep throwing enemies into 
the fireplace until you're allowed to move to the next area.<br>
<br>
Exit to the right. You are now in a room with a pair of Demon Generals and, an 
Orochi Hellbeast.<br>
<br>
Stay away from the Hellbeast, and knock the Demon Generals into the pair of 
hooks on the ceiling. This drops a wooden column in the back of the room.<br>
<br>
When both Generals have been hooked, finish off the Hellbeast.<br>
<br>
Wall Climb off the wooden pillar at the back of the room.<br>
<br>
Go right and long jump across a lava pool. Perform a Test of Might challenge at 
the edge of the room. Then long jump back across the lava pool.<br>
<br>
Go left and find a lava pool with spikes on the other side. Wall run diagonally 
up and to the left, and double jump just before you reach the spikes. This 
allows you to catch the ledge and reach the next room.<br>
<br>
The next room contains a gigantic pair of hammers that periodically strike 
together. Slay a host of Demons in here.<br>
<br>
Exit through the door on the left. Now you're back in the cauldron room. Drop to 
the lower floor (avoid the lava), and climb up the climbing wall at the left 
side of the room. Take the exit upstairs.<br>
<br>
You're now in the axe room. Complete a Test Your Might challenge to make a giant 
axe drop to the floor in the foreground. Grab the axe and slay a horde of 
Demons.<br>
<br>
Go back to the save point near the level start. Go up the ramp near the save 
point, turn right, and keep going straight.<br>
<br>
You reach a room with two huge crystals. Break these crystals with a power 
attack using your axe.<br>
<br>
Destroy the horde of creatures that appears. When they're gone, the doors slowly 
open. Take the doors to an outdoor area, and run up a fantastically long flight 
of stairs.<br>
<br>
At the top of the stairs are prison cells containing Johnny Cage and Kitana. 
There is a save point near the left cell. This is the last save point in the 
game.<br>
<br>
Now make your way towards the end of the hallway. Be prepared.<br>
