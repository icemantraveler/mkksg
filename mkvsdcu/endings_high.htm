As the worlds returned to normal, the Kombat Rage dissipated in its victims - 
except the Tarkatans.<br>
Through the Rage, the savage Outworld race has descended to an even greater 
level of bloodlust.<br>
Marking their foreheads with the blood of their enemies, they now storm 
throughout the realms, dominating all.<hr color="#333333">

Badly injured in the melee with the otherworldly invaders, Jax knew he must 
enhance his cybernetics to save his own life.<br>
He underwent massive anatomical restructuring, replacing most of his body with 
mechanized, fully armored versions.<br>
Jax is now more powerful than ever, but at the cost of his humanity.<hr color="#333333">

Though the Kombat Rage completely disappeared once Dark Kahn was defeated, it 
drove Kano irreversibly mad.<br>
Turning on friend and foe alike, he became an outcast. Kano's appearance changed 
as well.<br>
He has painted his face to further express his seething anger. Alone, in the 
depths of insanity, Kano endlessly repeats,<br>
&quot;Death to Shang Tsung... Death to Shang Tsung... DEATH TO SHANG TSUNG!&quot;<hr color="#333333">

With no base of operations after their devastating losses in Outworld, Kitana 
sought asylum in Earthrealm for her surviving Edenian Resistance fighters.<br>
Raiden granted them Shang Tsung's abandoned island, where they would remain 
hidden from mortal eyes.<br>
Kitana and her warriors remade the former site of the Mortal Kombat tournament 
into a bastion of beauty and Light.<br>
To honor the god of Edenia, they renamed their new home Argus Island.<hr color="#333333">

Through intense study, Raiden was able to unlock the secrets of the Rock of 
Eternity and determine its function.<br>
He decided to emulate it and create a Captain Marvel of Earthrealm. Raiden 
infused Liu Kang with his own power, as well as the abilities of his fellow gods 
Argus, Fujin and others.<br>
In order to transform himself into a being of unstoppable power, Liu Kang need 
only shout, &quot;Mortal Kombat!&quot;<hr color="#333333">

As the inter-dimensional conflict ended, Raiden returned to Earthrealm, only to 
discover that exposure to his homeworld's sun weakened him greatly.<br>
The sorcerer Quan Chi offered Raiden a jade-colored stone that would replenish 
his power - in return for his sworn allegiance.<br>
Where Quan Chi acquired this stone is a mystery. Raiden must now decide between 
servitude to an evil sorcerer... or mortality.<hr color="#333333">

Though Dark Kahn was defeated, his consciousness lived on.<br>
The Dark Lord's power and maliciousness found the perfect host in the body of 
the wrathful Scorpion.<br>
In the midst of his agony, Scorpion knew that he would soon be the most powerful 
creature in the universe - if he survived the transformation.<hr color="#333333">

Impressed with Captain Marvel's fighting ability but angered by his defeat at 
the hero's hands,<br>
Shang Tsung sought to create a race of super-warriors. They would have Captain 
Marvel's abilities, but would be a perversion of the hero's image.<br>
Through sorcery he combined blood from a torn piece of Captain Marvel's cape 
with the flesh of a Tarkatan corpse.<br>
Never before had his flesh pits echoed with the roar of such a monstrosity. With 
an army of Super-Tarkatans, Shang Tsung will be invincible!<hr color="#333333">

During the world-merge crisis, a member of the Green Lantern Corps was killed.<br>
At the moment of his death, his power ring traveled to Sonya, taking her as its 
new master.<br>
When the worlds were once again separated, the ring stayed with her. Now she has 
the ultimate weapon, but only one charge.<br>
She must use the ring sparingly until she can find a way to replenish its power.<hr color="#333333">

Fighting alongside the Forces of Light during the world-merge crisis, Sub-Zero 
came to a realization.<br>
He was no longer the assassin he had been; nor was he comfortable among the 
self-proclaimed defenders of Earthrealm.<br>
Inspired by one of the invaders, Sub-Zero decided he would work for the good of 
the realm, but on his own terms.<br>
He would be a mostly solitary figure, blending in with the dark and the cold.<br>
Sub-Zero left the Lin Kuei and donned a new costume befitting this new endeavor. 
But the Lin Kuei do not tolerate desertion, as he will soon discover....<hr color="#333333">

Defeated, Shao Kahn was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, used for holding 
dangerous Kryptonian villains because of its ability to render them powerless.<br>
Possibly due to the magical nature of his strength, however, the Phantom Zone 
had the opposite effect on Shao Kahn:<br>
Instead of neutralizing him, it revitalized the emperor, allowing him to break 
free.<br>
With him are untold numbers of criminals, released from millennia of 
imprisonment.<br>
Grateful, they have sworn allegiance to Shao Kahn and now follow him on his 
quest to konquer the universes.<hr color="#333333">

Concerned that other worlds might once again invade Earth,<br>
Batman created an autonomous global security system to monitor any temporal 
breaches.<br>
His system, OMAC (Outerworld Monitor and Auto-Containment), is designed to 
detect and trap invaders from alternate universes.<br>
OMAC has already discovered a breach in Metropolis....<hr color="#333333">

In order to regain control of his power, Captain Marvel was guided by the wizard 
Shazam through a focusing ritual.<br>
At its apex, Captain Marvel unexpectedly visited a strange, ethereal world,<br>
finding himself face to face with godlike beings calling themselves the &quot;Elder 
Gods.&quot;<br>
Now able to tap into these gods' powers, Captain Marvel has new abilities he is

Deathstroke emerged from the inter-universal conflict both wiser and more

As a result of Liu Kang's aura attunement, the Flash discovered he had retained 
a psychic bond with the warrior.<br>

On a distant planet, a huge pyramid unexpectedly rose from beneath the ground.<br>
Its origin was unknown, but it seemed to emanate energy similar to what Batman 
detected from the invading universe.<br>
Green Lantern's nemesis Sinestro has learned of the pyramid's existence and is 
eager to acquire whatever secret it might contain.<br>
Hal Jordan knows only that its energy is dangerous - and that the Green Lantern

In the midst of the magical assault, however, Darkseid reversed the soul drain, 
reducing Shang Tsung to a withered old man.<br>
Empowered by Shang Tsung's magic, Darkseid broke free of his bonds. Shang Tsung 
hastily pledged allegiance to Darkseid in an attempt to spare his own life.<hr color="#333333">
