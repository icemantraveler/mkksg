As the worlds returned to normal, the Kombat Rage dissipated in its victims - except the Tarkatans.<br>
Through the Rage, the savage Outworld race has descended to an even greater level of bloodlust.<br>
Marking their foreheads with the blood of their enemies, they now storm throughout the realms, dominating all.<hr class="main">

Badly injured in the melee with the otherworldly invaders, Jax knew he must enhance his cybernetics to save his own life.<br>
He underwent massive anatomical restructuring, replacing most of his body with mechanized, fully armored versions.<br>
Jax is now more powerful than ever, but at the cost of his humanity.<hr class="main">

Though the Kombat Rage completely disappeared once Dark Kahn was defeated, it drove Kano irreversibly mad.<br>
Turning on friend and foe alike, he became an outcast. Kano's appearance changed as well.<br>
He has painted his face to further express his seething anger. Alone, in the depths of insanity, Kano endlessly repeats,<br>
&quot;Death to Shang Tsung... Death to Shang Tsung... DEATH TO SHANG TSUNG!&quot;<hr class="main">

With no base of operations after their devastating losses in Outworld, Kitana sought asylum in Earthrealm for her surviving Edenian Resistance fighters.<br>
Raiden granted them Shang Tsung's abandoned island, where they would remain hidden from mortal eyes.<br>
Kitana and her warriors remade the former site of the Mortal Kombat tournament into a bastion of beauty and Light.<br>
To honor the god of Edenia, they renamed their new home Argus Island.<hr class="main">

Through intense study, Raiden was able to unlock the secrets of the Rock of Eternity and determine its function.<br>
He decided to emulate it and create a Captain Marvel of Earthrealm. Raiden infused Liu Kang with his own power, as well as the abilities of his fellow gods Argus, Fujin and others.<br>
In order to transform himself into a being of unstoppable power, Liu Kang need only shout, &quot;Mortal Kombat!&quot;<hr class="main">

As the inter-dimensional conflict ended, Raiden returned to Earthrealm, only to discover that exposure to his homeworld's sun weakened him greatly.<br>
The sorcerer Quan Chi offered Raiden a jade-colored stone that would replenish his power - in return for his sworn allegiance.<br>
Where Quan Chi acquired this stone is a mystery. Raiden must now decide between servitude to an evil sorcerer... or mortality.<hr class="main">

Though Dark Kahn was defeated, his consciousness lived on.<br>
The Dark Lord's power and maliciousness found the perfect host in the body of the wrathful Scorpion.<br>
In the midst of his agony, Scorpion knew that he would soon be the most powerful creature in the universe - if he survived the transformation.<hr class="main">

Impressed with Captain Marvel's fighting ability but angered by his defeat at the hero's hands,<br>
Shang Tsung sought to create a race of super-warriors. They would have Captain Marvel's abilities, but would be a perversion of the hero's image.<br>
Through sorcery he combined blood from a torn piece of Captain Marvel's cape with the flesh of a Tarkatan corpse.<br>
Never before had his flesh pits echoed with the roar of such a monstrosity. With an army of Super-Tarkatans, Shang Tsung will be invincible!<hr class="main">

During the world-merge crisis, a member of the Green Lantern Corps was killed.<br>
At the moment of his death, his power ring traveled to Sonya, taking her as its new master.<br>
When the worlds were once again separated, the ring stayed with her. Now she has the ultimate weapon, but only one charge.<br>
She must use the ring sparingly until she can find a way to replenish its power.<hr class="main">

Fighting alongside the Forces of Light during the world-merge crisis, Sub-Zero came to a realization.<br>
He was no longer the assassin he had been; nor was he comfortable among the self-proclaimed defenders of Earthrealm.<br>
Inspired by one of the invaders, Sub-Zero decided he would work for the good of the realm, but on his own terms.<br>
He would be a mostly solitary figure, blending in with the dark and the cold.<br>
Sub-Zero left the Lin Kuei and donned a new costume befitting this new endeavor. But the Lin Kuei do not tolerate desertion, as he will soon discover....<hr class="main">

Defeated, Shao Kahn was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone, used for holding dangerous Kryptonian villains because of its ability to render them powerless.<br>
Possibly due to the magical nature of his strength, however, the Phantom Zone had the opposite effect on Shao Kahn:<br>
Instead of neutralizing him, it revitalized the emperor, allowing him to break free.<br>
With him are untold numbers of criminals, released from millennia of imprisonment.<br>
Grateful, they have sworn allegiance to Shao Kahn and now follow him on his quest to konquer the universes.<hr class="main">

Concerned that other worlds might once again invade Earth,<br>
Batman created an autonomous global security system to monitor any temporal breaches.<br>
His system, OMAC (Outerworld Monitor and Auto-Containment), is designed to detect and trap invaders from alternate universes.<br>
OMAC has already discovered a breach in Metropolis....<hr class="main">

In order to regain control of his power, Captain Marvel was guided by the wizard Shazam through a focusing ritual.<br>
At its apex, Captain Marvel unexpectedly visited a strange, ethereal world,<br>
finding himself face to face with godlike beings calling themselves the &quot;Elder Gods.&quot;<br>
Now able to tap into these gods' powers, Captain Marvel has new abilities he is only just beginning to master.<hr class="main">

Having been infused with the power of magic during her teleportation, to the alternate universe.<br>
Catwoman found that she could transform at will into a black panther.<br>
Her increased strength and agility made her a cat that would never again be caged.<hr class="main">

Deathstroke emerged from the inter-universal conflict both wiser and more cautious.<br>
Assassins from another universe would be unwanted competition.<br>
To maintain superiority, Deathstroke created a band of powerful assassins outfitted in his image.<br>
He now serves as Grand Master of this fearsome DeathStrike Clan.<hr class="main">

As a result of Liu Kang's aura attunement, the Flash discovered he had retained a psychic bond with the warrior.<br>
The two agreed to warn each other of any cross-universal breaches.<br>
It wasn't long until Liu Kang appeared before the Flash, warning him of an impending attack by the sorcerer Quan Chi.<hr class="main">

On a distant planet, a huge pyramid unexpectedly rose from beneath the ground.<br>
Its origin was unknown, but it seemed to emanate energy similar to what Batman detected from the invading universe.<br>
Green Lantern's nemesis Sinestro has learned of the pyramid's existence and is eager to acquire whatever secret it might contain.<br>
Hal Jordan knows only that its energy is dangerous - and that the Green Lantern Corps must stop the Sinestro Corps at any cost.<hr class="main">

As the worlds separated, the Joker discovered he had retained his new powers. With them he soon controlled all of Gotham, proclaiming himself &quot;Mayor Joker.&quot;<br>
Under his rule, the city devolved into chaos. He now holds a tournament in which &quot;contestants&quot; are forced to fight to the death for his amusement.<br>
The winner will face off against the Joker himself.<hr class="main">

Using data stolen from the Special Forces, Lex Luthor constructed his own portal and breached the barrier that separated two universes.<br>
There he encountered the sorcerer Quan Chi. Their combined power, intelligence and near omnipresence will be unstoppable.<br>
Both worlds will fall prey to this Deadly Alliance.<hr class="main">

After his encounter with the invaders and their magical powers, Superman knew he was vulnerable to similar assaults in the future.<br>
With the aid of the wizard Shazam, he applied ancient Kryptonian lore to the creation of a new costume, giving him resistance to magic.<br>
Attacks by sorcerers and demons now have no effect on the Man of Steel.<hr class="main">

Returning to Themyscira, Wonder Woman learned that strange relics had been found scattered across the island: a sword, a shield and a golden amulet, all pulsing with energy. Compelled to equip herself with the items, she was infused with powers beyond those 
bestowed upon her by the Greek gods.<br>
She and her Amazons are now unstoppable as they fight for the preservation of Earth.<hr class="main">

Imprisoned in the Netherrealm, Darkseid was left vulnerable. Shang Tsung attempted to steal Darkseid's soul, a source of immense power.<br>
In the midst of the magical assault, however, Darkseid reversed the soul drain, reducing Shang Tsung to a withered old man.<br>
Empowered by Shang Tsung's magic, Darkseid broke free of his bonds. Shang Tsung hastily pledged allegiance to Darkseid in an attempt to spare his own life.<hr class="main">
