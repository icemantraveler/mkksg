Cyrax is captured by Sub-Zero and reprogrammed with new orders: to destroy Shao 
Kahn. With Kahn unable to detect his assassin's soulless presence, Cyrax 
delivers a successful sneak attack.<br>
However, after eliminating Kahn and saving Earth, Cyrax awaits new orders from 
his Lin Kuei headquarters. The orders never come and Cyrax malfunctions. He ends 
up stranded in the middle of a vast desert, blindly heading toward his base.<hr color="#333333">

The second time Jax battles the forces of Shao Kahn he comes prepared. Thought 
to be the strongest man on Earth, he has no problem proving it: First by beating 
Kahn's armies and then by defeating the Emperor himself.<br>
When the world reverts back to normal, Jax and Sonya start the Outerworld 
Investigation Agency. Jax runs the exploratory division which learns to open 
portals through science rather than magic. He leads the first expedition into a 
mysterious new realm.<hr color="#333333">

After returning from near death, Kabal swears revenge against his attackers. He 
fights alongside the other Earth warriors. When he defeats Motaro and the mighty 
Shao Kahn he proves that he truly is the chosen one.<br>
Before the invasion, Kabal lived a life of crime. He was once a member of the 
Black Dragon along with Kano. Now Kabal devotes his life to fighting injustice. 
He will give crime's inner circles a new reason to fear.<hr color="#333333">

When Shao Kahn lets Kano live he fails to realize the resourcefulness of the 
scheming human. Kano lures Kahn's armies away on a false mission: then nukes 
them using a stolen weapon. He fights the remaining warriors and finally defeats 
Kahn himself.<br>
Kano's true intention is to take over the souls which Kahn once possessed. But 
Kano is unable to control the spirits as they escape and attack him. Rumored to 
have suffered a violent death, Kano was ignorant of the fact that he saved the 
world he tried to conquer.<hr color="#333333">

When Shao Kahn invades Earth, Kung Lao must scrap his plans of reuniting the 
White Lotus Society. He instead must focus on the new tournament. He seeks Liu 
Kang and together they battle Kahn's forces fearlessly.<br>
Using the knowledge he obtained as a Shaolin monk he fights in the name of his 
great ancestor - the original Kung Lao. He emerges victorious but suffers from 
injuries during battle with Kahn. Believed to have passed away, Kung Lao joins 
his ancestors in a new life.<hr color="#333333">

After thwarting Shao Kahn in the past, Liu Kang finds himself the prime target 
of Shao Kahn's extermination squads. But Kang is the reigning Mortal Kombat 
champion and proves it by easily defeating Kahn's minions.<br>
But it's the apparent death of his friend Kung Lao that enrages Kang and enables 
him to find the strength to defeat Shao Kahn. Then, before the portal closes, 
Liu Kang is greeted by Princess Kitana and thanked for saving the Earth and the 
Outworld.<hr color="#333333">

Nightwolf helps the other Earth warriors escape to his sacred land. Once there, 
they regroup and plan a form of attack against Shao Kahn's invasion. Nightwolf 
has trained hard for this battle. Finally, he faces Shao Kahn and emerges 
victorious.<br>
When the Earth returns to its normal state, Nightwolf peacefully regains his 
land his Native-American people lost over many years. They establish their own 
proud nation and soon become the great leaders of Earth.<hr color="#333333">

After eventually terminating Sub-Zero, Sektor is attacked by Shao Kahn's army. 
Unfamiliar with the Outworld warriors, Sektor fights back. He targets Kahn and 
all Outworld beings as threats to the Lin Kuei.<br>
Kahn's minions are no match for Sektor, who fights his way into the fortress. 
Once inside, Sektor initiates his self-destruct sequence. The resulting 
explosion is so massive that it closes the portal and returns Earth back to 
normal.<hr color="#333333">

When Shao Kahn overtakes the Earth, he needs Shang Tsung to help locate the 
surviving humans. Granted new powers, Tsung soon discovers his dark emperor's 
true plan: as soon as the remaining warriors are disposed of, Kahn will take 
Tsung's own soul.<br>
After learning this, Tsung turns on his master. He catches Motaro off guard and 
then defeats Shao Kahn. But before the Earth can return to normal, Tsung takes 
all the souls as his own. He will forever rule the Earth with his own brand of 
evil.<hr color="#333333">

While Sheeva serves her master on Earth, her race of Shokan are being punished 
on the Outworld. Kahn now favors Motaro's race of centaurs and aids them in 
defeating the Shokan. After learning of these events, Sheeva turns on her 
master.<br>
She defeats Motaro and in a rage brings down Kahn. In freeing the Earth, she 
also frees the Outworld. She then returns home and works to restore the pride 
and respect of her race.<hr color="#333333">

Sindel receives visions of her true past and turns against Shao Kahn. She 
discovers that her true king was named Jerrod. They once had a daughter named 
Kitana and ruled a realm called Edenia, before Kahn took it away in their own 
Mortal Kombat.<br>
He uses Sindel as a pawn in his quest for Earth and took Kitana as his own 
daughter. But in defeating Shao Kahn, Sindel frees the Earth. In doing so, she 
also liberates Edenia and assures a reunion with her 10,000 year old daughter - 
Kitana.<hr color="#333333">

Sonya defeats her arch-enemy Kano high atop a skyscraper near Shao Kahn's 
fortress. She then comes face to face with the emperor himself. In an incredible 
display of courage, Sonya wins.<br>
When the world returns to its normal state, Sonya has no trouble convincing her 
superiors to form the Outerworld Investigation Agency, devoted to protecting the 
Earth against possible future invasions from other realms.<hr color="#333333">

a vision from Raiden. He is instructed to travel west. He eventually meets the 
rest of Earth's warriors and learns the true meaning of his survival.<br>

new kombatant and is caught off guard. Stryker defeats the warlord and saves the

In vicious battle, Sub-Zero faces Cyrax and Sektor: but not alone. He finds his 
third Lin Kuei assassin - the elusive Smoke. Before automation, Smoke and

Sub-Zero defeats his cyborg assassins with the help of Smoke and finds it takes 
all of his own inner strengths to defeat Kahn and his Outworld minions. The

Rain fights valiantly for the emperor Shao Kahn. But it would be Kahn's own step 
daughter, the princess Kitana who turns Rain against him. Like Kitana, Rain's 
origins also come from their former realm of Edenia.<br>
He learns that his father was once a general in Edenia's army and died at the 
hands of Shao Kahn himself. Enraged at the truth about his history, he joins 
Kitana in aligning with the Earth Realm warriors.<br>
But his allegiance comes under question when he mysteriously disappears during 
an extermination squad attack. To prove his loyalty he embarked on a suicide 
mission to destroy Shao Kahn and end the menace once and for all.<hr color="#333333">
