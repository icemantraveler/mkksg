The Story<hr class="main">

&quot;You have been chosen to represent Earth in Mortal Kombat. Be warned.<br>
Although your souls are protected against Shao Kahn's evil; your lives are not.<br>
I cannot interfere any longer as your world is now ruled by the Outworld gods.&quot;<br>
<br>
These are the words of Raiden<br>
<br>
For centuries, Earth has used Mortal Kombat to defend itself against the Outworld's 
Emperor Shao Kahn.<br>
But, Kahn becomes frustrated by failed attempts at taking Earth through tournament 
battle.<br>
He enacts a plan which began 10,000 years ago.<br>
<br>
During this time, Kahn had a queen. Her name was Sindel and her young death was 
unexpected.<br>
Kahn's shadow priests, lead by Shang Tsung, make it so Sindel's spirit would someday 
be reborn;<br>
not on the Outworld, but on the Earth realm itself.<br>
<br>
This unholy act gives Shao Kahn the power to step through the dimensional gates 
and reclaim his queen.<br>
Thus, enabling him to finally seize the Earth realm.<br>
<br>
Upon breaching the Portal into Earth, Shao Kahn slowly transforms the planet into 
a part of the Outworld itself.<br>
<br>
He then strips the Earth of all human life, claiming every soul as his own.<br>
<br>
But, there are souls which Kahn cannot take.<br>
These souls belong to the warriors chosen to represent Earth in a new Mortal Kombat.<br>
<br>
The remaining humans are scattered throughout the planet.<br>
Shao Kahn sends an army of fierce Outworld warriors to find and eliminate them.</center>
