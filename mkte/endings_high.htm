Bo' Rai Cho looked gruff, but beamed inwardly. With their victory over the 
Deadly Alliance complete, he and Kung Lao had liberated Outworld from its latest 
threat. Despite the years that had passed since training his last student, his 
skills had proven useful once more. He was elated, but it would be most 
inappropriate to express such emotions in front of his newest apprentice.<br>
<a href="../mk5/endings/end_bo2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="../mk5/endings/end_bo2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Kung Lao invited his master to return with him to Earthrealm, to teach more 
warriors at the Wu Shi Academy. The success of his apprentice gave him renewed 
confidence in his training skills and, for the first time, a clear purpose in 
life. Bo' Rai Cho offered only token resistance. He accepted the offer because 
the defenders of Earthrealm could certainly use his help. But more importantly, 
because Earthrealm's rice wine put Outworld's liquor to shame.<hr color="#333333">

<img src="../mk5/endings/end_cyrax1.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
The enormous heat and pressure of the lava burned out Cyrax's sensors almost 
immediately. He cast about blindly in the infernal pit, searching for the orb 
Nitara had sent him to locate. Cyrax found it resting upon a small submerged 
pedestal beneath the molten depths. As soon as he clambered to the surface, she 
demanded he hand over the Orb.<br>
<a href="../mk5/endings/end_cyrax2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="../mk5/endings/end_cyrax2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Nitara had promised to return Cyrax to Earthrealm once the orb had been 
retrieved. Taking her necklace in hand, she uttered a mystical incantation. A 
swirling portal opened around Cyrax and he only had time for a solemn bow before 
he was swept into the gateway.<hr color="#333333">

Upset by the way his adventures had been portrayed in the past, Johnny Cage 
found a loophole in his contract and left MCM studios during the production of 
&quot;Mortal Kombat: The Death of Johnny Cage&quot;. He then used his own money to fund 
the production of his next movie, which is rumored to be the true story of his 
latest adventures in Outworld.<br>

&quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; broke all records in its first weekend in 
theaters, and made Johnny Cage extremely wealthy. The movie told the true story 
of how Johnny Cage single handedly saved the world from the threat of Quan Chi 
and Shang Tsung's deadly alliance.<hr color="#333333">

<img src="../mk5/endings/end_mavado1.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
For many years Mavado's Red Dragon clan had been secretly engineering the 
destruction of their rivals, the Black Dragon. Through careful manipulation, 
Mavado had used the Special Forces to unwittingly aid them in this task. In 
return for eliminating Kenshi for the Deadly Alliance, Mavado was finally 
granted his battle with the last known member of the Black Dragon: Kano. After a 
long, brutal fight, Mavado emerged victorious and all traces of the Black Dragon 
had been erased.<br>
<a href="../mk5/endings/end_mavado2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="../mk5/endings/end_mavado2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Impressed with the fighting skill and discipline of Mavado as well as other 
members of his clan, Quan Chi realized the potential the Red Dragon held for 
staging the eventual invasion of Earthrealm. In return for their continued 
assistance, he offered crucial information about a new threat to Mavado's Red 
Dragon clan... the Lin Kuei.<hr color="#333333">

After what seemed like an eternity, Cyrax finally emerged from the lava, holding 
the Orb that had bound Nitara's realm to Outworld for ages. At last it was 
within her grasp. She would be able to free her people from Shao Kahn's 
imprisonment. Fulfilling her end of the bargain, she sent Cyrax back to his 
Earthrealm home in exchange for the Orb.<br>

<img src="../mk5/endings/end_nitara2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Nitara stared into the Orb. It seethed with the power trapped within. She raised 
it above her head, and then smashed it to the floor. It shattered with an 
inhuman, soul-rending howl. Its horrible energy exploded away, and tore her 
consciousness from her. She awoke later for the first time on her native soil.<hr color="#333333">

The Deadly Alliance was successful in reviving the mummified remains of the 
Dragon King's undefeatable army. It would appear that nothing could stand in the 
way of Shang Tsung and Quan Chi as they began their domination of the realms. 
Unfortunately for Shang Tsung, however, Quan Chi had no further need for the 
partnership. Once Shang Tsung had finally revived the last of the mummified 
warriors, Quan Chi closed the portal to The Heavens and effectively shut off 
Shang Tsung's endless supply of souls. Quan Chi then instructed Kano to 
assassinate Shang Tsung in a surprise weapon attack. With their captor cut wide 
open, the thousands of souls Shang Tsung had consumed in the past spewed forth 
and swirled around the room.<br>
<a href="../mk5/endings/end_quan2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="../mk5/endings/end_quan2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Quan Chi came to the realization that if Kano could so easily turn on Shang 
Tsung, he could also turn on Quan Chi himself. Quan Chi used his sorcery to 
drain the life from Kano and left his body where it fell. Immediately one of the 
lingering souls shot into Kano's body. To Quan Chi's surprise, the man standing 
before him was no longer the Black Dragon thug known as Kano. Kano's body now 
contained the soul of the Shaolin monk... Liu Kang.<hr color="#333333">

Once again, the threat to Earthrealm has been vanquished. The Deadly Alliance is 
no more. What dangers lie in the future, I can no longer foresee. Perhaps the 
Dragon King will, in fact, return. Perhaps the depths of the Netherrealm will 
spew forth a legion of Oni. Even the Vampire people pose a threat to peace now 
that Outworld is in chaos. But one thing is certain... Earthrealm must be 
protected.<br>

I have abandoned my status as Elder God to aid these mortals... an act defiant 
of the Heavens. I will instead remain here on Earth... as GOD OF THUNDER.<hr color="#333333">

While in Outworld, the demon known as Sareena encountered Sub-Zero. Since she 
had freed his brother from his confines of the Netherrealm so many years ago, 
Sub-Zero offered her asylum within the Lin Kuei.<br>
<a href="ending_sareena2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img border="1" alt="Click For Larger Image!" src="ending_sareena2.jpg" width="400" height="138"></a><br>
His compassion may be honorable, but befriending a demon of The Netherrealm is 
not an action without risk... as Sub-Zero may soon discover.<hr color="#333333">

<img src="../mk5/endings/end_scorpion1.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
The hunt for Quan Chi had led Scorpion to the palace of Shang Tsung. Scorpion 
entered the palace through a hidden passage. As he made his way through the 
lower levels, he was discovered by the two Oni he had previously encountered 
while in the Netherrealm. Shang Tsung had secretly allied with Moloch and 
Drahmin as a backup defense against Quan Chi. The two Oni had been hidden in an 
underground chamber and were periodically fed mortals to keep them satisfied.<br>
<a href="../mk5/endings/end_scorpion2.jpg" target="_blank">
<img src="../mk5/endings/end_scorpion2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Scorpion fought well but was overpowered by Moloch and Drahmin. Although the 
could not consume the ninja spectre, they devised another means for eliminating 
their foe that would satisfy their cruel nature. The Oni brought Scorpion before 
the portal to The Heavens that Shang Tsung had tapped as a source of limitless 
souls. They hurled him into the Soulnado and his hellspawn body was ripped apart 
by the purity of that realm.<hr color="#333333">

The Deadly Alliance was successful in reviving the mummified remains of the 
Dragon King's undefeatable army. Shang Tsung, however, began to realize that his 
relevance in the partnership had evaporated once his talents for soul 
transplantation were no longer needed. The balance of power within the Deadly 
Alliance had seemingly been undone. Fearing betrayal, he secretly instructed 
Kano to steal Quan Chi's amulet in an attempt to gain control of the army. Since 
part of the soul-transfer spell included the command to obey 'He who possesses 
the amulet,' the army would obey only Shang Tsung, and not Quan Chi, once the 
amulet was in his possession.<br>

<img src="../mk5/endings/end_shang2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Amulet in hand, Shang Tsung revealed his betrayal to Quan Chi and commanded the 
army to destroy the sorcerer. Shang Tsung would succeed where others had failed. 
He would conquer the realms. He would conquer Earth.<hr color="#333333">

Sent by the sorcerer Shang Tsung, the two Oni known as Drahmin and Moloch 
confronted Quan Chi, enraged that he had tried to leave them stranded in the 
bowels of the Netherrealm. In the battle that ensued, Drahmin leapt at Quan Chi 
and both kombatants stumbled into the Inner Sanctum Chamber.<br>

Hsu Hao reported to his superior, Mavado, and informed him of his success in 
destroying the Special Forces Outerworld Investigation Agency. Mavado then 
informed Hsu Hao of his next objective...<br>

<img src="../mk5/endings/end_hsu2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
It seemed that Quan Chi was proving to be a powerful ally and was willing to aid 
the Red Dragon in its quest for domination of Earth. In a show of good faith, 
Mavado agreed to destroy Quan Chi's enemies. The sorcerer suspected betrayal 
from Shang Tsung. There was evidence that Shang Tsung had allied with the two 
Oni known as Moloch and Drahmin. Hsu Hao's new orders were to eliminate the 
sorcerer Shang Tsung before the Oni eliminated Quan Chi.<hr color="#333333">

Despite the strong sulphurous stench that filled the chamber, Reptile could 
smell that Nitara and Cyrax had been there recently. There was no sign of them 
now, except for some scattered glass shards and a residual trace of strong 
magical energies. His revenge would have to wait.<br>

<img src="../mk5/endings/end_reptile2.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="Click For Larger Image!" border="1"></a><br>
Suddenly an expectant hush filled the chamber as energy cascaded around what 
appeared to be a dragon embryo. The tiny dragon stretched and the egg cracked. A 
beam of energy ripped out from inside and lanced into Reptile. His world was 
filled with roaring power as his squamous body was twisted and transformed. The 
ancient prophecy had been fulfilled: the Dragon King had returned.<hr color="#333333">
