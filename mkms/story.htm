The Story</center>
<hr class="main">

Shao Kahn wasn't the first to attack our realm... Thousands of years ago, Shinnok 
existed as an Elder God. The Elder Gods are the true rulers of all realms. They 
watch as worlds are created and destroyed and govern the realms with untold eons 
of wisdom. Shinnok, however, gave in to greed and illusions of false power by the 
new realm of Earth. If he could have that realm to himself, he would have power 
unmatched. He first would have to face the young god of thunder known as Raiden, 
who was appointed as Earth's guardian by the Elder Gods themselves. Their battle 
for the realm of Earth was fierce; causing the planet's near destruction and plunging 
it into centuries of darkness.<br>
<br>
Raiden soon discovered that Shinnok entered the realm through the powers of a mystical 
amulet. It allowed Shinnok to enter the realm without challenge and keep the other 
Elder Gods from intervening. The amulet could only be created once, and Raiden stripped 
it from Shinnok's possession. With the aid of the true Elder gods, he banished the 
fallen god into a place known as the Netherrealm. Raiden buried the amulet deep 
within the mountains of Asia. He then created a massive temple within the mountain 
to house the amulet, and appointed four guardians as the protectors of Shinnok's 
sacred amulet. Each guardian represents one of the four elements that make up the 
realm: Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire. As long as the amulet remained on Earth, Shinnok 
would be trapped, forced to remain dormant for the rest of eternity.<br>
<br>
Over the millennia, the Netherrealm has had many rulers. Most of them were forged 
within it's fiery pits, eventually ripping their masters mercilessly from their 
thrones. One, however, came not from the bowels of the Netherrealm, but from the 
heavens of reality. He was the fallen Elder God known as Shinnok.<br>
<br>
Upon entering the realm, Shinnok found himself immediately under attack by its then 
ruler Lucifer. He would exist tortured and tormented by the dregs of hell for thousands 
of years. Until he met Quan Chi.<br>
<br>
Quan Chi is a free roaming sorcerer. That means that he can travel the various planes 
of reality without detection from their gods. It also means that over the years 
he has obtained great power. Aware of Shinnok's dilemma, Quan Chi traveled to the 
Netherrealm and made the fallen god an offer. He will free him from his confines 
and assist him in defeating Lucifer and his minions, in exchange for power and the 
ability to rule at his side if and when he escapes the Netherrealm entirely. Shinnok 
agreed and the two waged a war in the Netherrealm that lasted for centuries. But, 
the ex-Elder God eventually won as he viciously slew his former master, then took 
his seat as the new ruler supreme of the dead realm. Shinnok, however, had nothing 
to rule. The realm was a desolate wasteland of fire and brimstone inhabited by grotesque 
demons. So, he decided to create a physical world, trying his best to emulate the 
realm he wanted so badly... Earth.<br>
<br>
He took the demons of his realm and transformed them into as human a form as possible. 
But unlike the Outworld, which became a wasteland after Shao Kahn sapped its energies, 
the Netherrealm never was a living planet. It always will exist as a dead world. 
Its true form hidden by its ruler.<br>
<br>
It was through the Mortal Kombat tournament that the Outworld's soul-stealing sorcerer 
Shang Tsung discovered the location of the sacred Map of Elements. After Goro, the 
reigning Outworld champion, defeated the first Kung Lao over 400 years ago, Shang 
Tsung sapped the human's soul. He retained his thoughts and memories thus discovering 
the secrets of the sacred map, which has been hidden within the Shaolin temples 
for centuries. These events enabled Shang Tsung to strike a bargain with Quan Chi.<br>
<br>
In exchange for Shinnok's assistance in a plot to reincarnate the Outworld Emperor 
Shao Kahn's dead queen, Shang Tsung would reveal to Quan Chi the location of the 
map that would lead to Shinnok's sacred amulet. But, Shang Tsung failed to inform 
Quan Chi of the elemental guards that protect the amulet. Their mere existence makes 
it impossible for Quan Chi to enter the temple where the amulet rests. But, if he 
could get a human to enter, the right human, one who could perhaps defeat the elements...<hr class="main">
