<u><b><a href="#TOP" name="L1">Level 1: The Shaolin Temples</a></b></u><br>
<br>
You start off by seeing Sub-Zero jumping through a window. Scorpion is standing 
there and he says &quot;You will fail&quot;, then he laughs and runs off. Go to 
your right and through the door into the next room, there waiting, are 2 monks, 
kill them! (Use combos to defeat them so you will earn experience points) Walk through 
the corridor, take the herbal healer. Walk through the next corridor and take the 
tablet of truth. It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;THE PILLARS CAN BE ACTIVATED WITH A CAREFULLY PLACED SWEEP KICK. YOU ARE FREE 
TO RUN WHEN THEY ARE ON THE RISE.&quot;<br>
<br>
Follow the tablets instructions to pass the 2 pillars to your right, then proceed 
through the door into the next room. There you will fight a monk. Defeat him and 
take the herbal healer. Then fight and beat another monk. Walk out onto the balcony 
and take the tablet of truth. It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;USE THE BALCONY'S LEDGE TO CAREFULLY LAND ON THE TARP BELOW.&quot;<br>
<br>
Follow these instructions and you will make a safe landing to the ground which is 
a checkpoint. Walk to your right and take the herbal healer (use if necessary) By 
now you should have the power to throw ice and do the slide. Walk to your left and 
into the building where you will fight a monk. Keep going to your left into the 
door and fight another monk. Walk back to your right and then left to find 2 more 
monks before going on. After killing 4 or 5 monks, proceed carefully to your left 
into the room with the pillars. Trip the first and run just past it stopping on 
the middle square on the floor. Trip the next pillar, then run past it. (You may 
have to fight another monk). Go to your left into the next room and kill the monk 
then take the herbal healer that is near the rope (Don't climb it!!). Keep going 
to your left into the next corridor and kill the monk. Go left through the door 
and into the next room.<br>
<br>
There you will meet Scorpion and he says: &quot;The map is mine Sub-Zero.&quot; 
Now beat him using freezes and combos. When you beat him, the MK voice will say &quot;Finish 
Him&quot;. Standing one step away, motion F, D, F, HP (this is the spine rip fatality!). 
Go to the platform to your left and take the tablet of truth. It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;ONCE THE SACRED MAP IS IN YOUR POSSESSION, YOU WILL FIND ESCAPE AT THE TEMPLE'S 
TOWER.&quot;<br>
<br>
Take the map, when you do a door will open in the tower. Go back to your right to 
the room with the rope and climb it. When you get to the top, face the right and 
jump onto the angled rope and slide down. You will see a cinematic with Sub-Zero, 
Quan-Chi, and the Grand Master.<br>
<br>
<b>Pillars:</b> The falling pillar traps in this level drop down when any object 
move underneath them. To get past a pillar, do a LK at around sweep distance to 
lure it down, quickly run past it when it's pulling itself back up.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Scorpion Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_1scorpion.jpg" title="Scorpion Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - Scorpion:</b> He can be easily defeated using freezes, uppercuts, and 
combos. Avoid throwing him unless you freeze him first. You can finish him off with 
your <a href="controls.htm#FAT">Fatality</a> (F, D, F, <b>HP</b>) after you defeat 
him.<br>
<br>
<a href="#TOP">Return To Top</a><hr class="main">

<u><b><a href="#TOP" name="L2">Level 2: The Wind Element</a></b></u><br>
<br>
Go inside the cave and kill the monk. Walk to your right and take the table of truth. 
It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;USE THE WIND GUSTS TO CARRY YOU TO THE NEXT PLATFORM&quot;.<br>
<br>
When you see the debris blowing up through the gap, jump to the right and the gust 
of wind will take you to the next platform. Jump and grab the next platform and 
pull yourself up. Kill the monk. Then jump down to the next platform and wait for 
a gust of wind. Jump right and it will take you up to the next platform. Walk right 
until you get to the next gap. (This spot is tricky). Jump to the next platform, 
but instead of killing the monk, immediately jump to the next platform because this 
one is crumbling. On the next platform, don't worry about the potion, jump to the 
next platform because this one is crumbling too. Jump right to the next platform 
and take the herbal healer. Then jump to the next platform and kill the monk. Proceed 
to the next platform and kill the monk. (this is a check point). Take the table 
of truth. It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;WHEN JUMPING ONTO MOVING PLATFORMS, TIME YOUR JUMP BEFORE THE PLATFORM IS 
IN LINE. ALSO REMEMBER, YOU STILL HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER YOUR VELOCITY WHILE AIRBORNE&quot;<br>
<br>
(This part is tricky, it may take a few times falling to get the timing right.) 
After you clear all the rotating windmills, walk across the bridge until you get 
to the next gap. Take the wind gust to the next platform, but be quick, because 
the platform is crumbling. Jump on the first rope and climb down to the end of it. 
Jump to the platform on the left and take the potion (its also a 1up). Then jump 
on the ropes and transfer across them until the last one. Take the wind gust up 
to the next platforms. Go left and follow the platforms all the way up to get a 
key. (this is a checkpoint). Then proceed right. Go across the bridge and kill the 
monk. Go right to the next platform and kill the monk. Take the wind gusts to the 
next 2 platforms. While on the circle on this platform, use the wind icon key.<br>
<br>
Jump into the wind tunnel, but don't let it take you too high up, direct yourself 
to the platform just across the screen at the bottom. Go onto the next platform, 
walk on the bridge and let it fall (you will lose a small piece of energy). There 
is a key and a check point on the little platform to your left. After getting the 
key, go back to the wind tunnel and take it all the way up and to the right. Use 
the key to open the door. Fight a monk then take the tablet of truth. It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;PUSH A FROZEN MONK OVER THE FLOOR SWITCH TO ACTIVATE THE DOOR AND KEEP IT 
OPEN&quot;.<br>
<br>
Follow the directions on the tablet and then take the key. As soon as you take the 
key, run quickly to you left and back out the door, because it activates a fan that 
will drag you in and kill you. Kill the monk and then go back to the ledge. (check 
point). Carefully go back down the wind tunnel to the platform on the right. Proceed 
to your right and up on the next platform. Jump into the cave looking platform, 
then jump to the next platform and kill the monk. Now for some tricky jumping. Make 
it across these swings the best you can. (I like to wait for the swing that I am 
on to start coming back down and then jump to the next one). After you make it past 
the swings, use the key to open the door. Proceed across the platforms to your right, 
but be quick, because they are crumbling. Now you are at more swings, jump across 
these and then jump across to the next platform and kill the 2 monks. Jump to the 
next platform (this is a check point). Maneuver across a few more rotating windmills 
(carefully), then jump to the next platform. Go right across the swing and up on 
the next platform and kill the monk. Go to the next platform and let the gust of 
wind take you up.<br>
<br>
Now you face off with Fujin (By this point you should be able to freeze at an upward 
angle, which comes in handy against the flighty Fujin. [angle freeze : D, DF, F, 
LK] ). After you beat Fujin, get as far left as possible. When the wind starts pulling 
you in, run the opposite way until the wind stops. Then you begin to vaporize and 
you reappear underground.<br>
<br>
<b>Spinning Platforms:</b> The small circular platforms on fans can be tricky to 
get past, but is fairly simple once you get your timing right. Be sure to control 
the velocity of your jump using back while you are in the air.<br>
<br>
<b>Swinging Platforms:</b> The stone platforms swinging toward and away from the 
camera view are also fairly easy once you get the hang of getting past them. Your &quot;3D&quot; 
Z-plane position on the still- standing platform before the first swing of each 
set is actually equal to the position of the swing when it reaches its peak toward 
the camera view. So in order to land on one, your feet should leave the platform 
just a slight moment after the swing has reached its peak position away from the 
camera view. Also don't forget to control the velocity of your jump for these as 
well, or you will jump right past the swing.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Fujin Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_2god_wind_fujin.jpg" title="Fujin Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - Fujin, God of Wind:</b> Fujin is the hardest boss in all of MKMS. As soon 
as the fight begins, run in and throw. Try to keep throwing him as much as possible 
before he starts to fly. If he flies, freeze him with a diagonal ice blast as fast 
as possible and jump kick him to ground him again, then continue throwing him as 
many times as you can. Once you have drained Fujin's energy, quickly walk to the 
LEFT edge of the platform, while he prepares a tornado in the center of the area. 
When the tornado begins, DO NOT run left, just slowly walk toward the left or hold 
down+left to duck. After a moment, if you have managed to stay in that position 
near the left edge, you will automatically hang on to the platform and Fujin's tornado 
will cause himself to explode.<br>
<br>
<a href="#TOP">Return To Top</a><hr class="main">

<u><b><a href="#TOP" name="L3">Level 3: The Earth Element</a></b></u><br>
<br>
Right away, a monk will attack, beat him and then go right. A crevice will appear 
in the ground, jump over it and go right. Jump through the 2 mechanical crushers, 
then take the table of truth. It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;NOT ALL CREVICE OPENINGS LEAD TO DEATH. SOME CAN LEAD TO WEALTH AND GOOD FORTUNE.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jump past the mechanical crushers and fall into the hole. Take all the goodies, 
then let the spring throw you back up. Go to your right. When you get to the swinging 
axes, stop. Jump 3 times to get past these (time your jumps carefully). Cross the 
hole with the rope (do not go down it yet!). Time your jump so you miss the swinging 
ax on the other side. Then jump through the mechanical crushers and over the developing 
crevice. The next part is tricky, you have to get between the 2 swinging axes to 
get the key, but make sure that the crevice is closed before you try and get it. 
Once you have the key, go to your right. Jump through the first mechanical crusher 
and get the potion, then go back left and to the shaft with the rope. Climb down 
the rope quickly and use the key to open the door at the bottom (be quick or get 
crushed). Walk through the door (check point). You will then meet up with 2 monks, 
fight and kill them. Go to your right to the mechanical spring. Let it throw you 
up and to the left. Take the Dit Dow formula. Jump through the mechanical crusher 
and get the table of truth. It reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;USE YOUR FREEZING ABILITY TO STOP THE MEDITATING MONK WHEN HE'S IN TRANSITION&quot;
<br>
<br>
Fall down in the hole to one side or the other and take both of the herbal healers, 
then fall down to the bottom level. Take the spring back up but this time go to 
the right. Watch out for the meditating monks! Jump the monk and the crevice and 
stop where you see a rope hanging. Turn and face left and freeze the monk just as 
he is in transition. Face right and do the same to the other meditating monk. Then 
jump the crevice and proceed to the right. Go through the door, and there you will 
meet the Earth God. To beat him you need to slide between his legs then run to the 
right and get the tablet of truth. It reads: <br>
<br>
&quot;LURE THE EARTH GOD INTO THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. USE THE SKULL SWITCH TO DROP 
THE CHAINED PLATFORM ON TOP OF HIM FOR GREATER DAMAGE&quot;<br>
<br>
Follow these directions and you should have him after a few drops!! After you beat 
him, pull the skull switch one more time and run quickly and jump on the chained 
platform. Ride it to the top and grab the key, then ride it back to the floor. Go 
to your left to where the rope is hanging, while standing under it, use the key 
that you just picked up to open the door. Climb the rope all the way to the top 
and go left. (Be careful not to get hit by the mechanical crusher). After going 
through the 2 mechanical crushers, go left. Jump past the 2 swinging axes and over 
the crevice. Jump the next crevice and then jump through the crusher, then past 
the swinging ax to the circle on the ground. This is a check point.<br>
<br>
Go left past the swinging axes until you get to the mechanical spring. Jump on that 
and let it throw you up into the cavern. Go up to the right and beat the meditating 
monk. Take the key and fall in the hole. Take the spring back up to the other side 
of the gate. There you will find a monk. Beat him and take the eye of invisibility. 
Jump across the hole with the rope. Go past all the swinging axes and crevices. 
Jump through the mechanical crushers and take all the potions. Go back left and 
go up the rope. Jump off the rope to your right and fight all the monks. Then go 
all the way left and use the key to open the door to the next mission. Once again 
you vaporize, but this time you reappear in a underwater passageway.<br>
<br>
<b>Swinging Traps:</b> A swinging trap will knock you back and take away a bit of 
your energy if you stand too close to one, but will instantly chop you up into pieces 
if you stand right in the middle of it. Get past it by running past once it has 
reached its peak in the direction toward the camera. Be careful not to run too far 
past though, since there may either be another trap or a ditch right past it.<br>
<br>
<b>Floating Monks:</b> The floating monks can easily be destroyed by freezing them 
right at the moment they are teleporting.<br>
<br>
<img alt="God of Earth Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_3god_earth.jpg" title="God of Earth Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - God of Earth:</b> The God of Earth is strong but slow. Get past him by 
sliding; this might come in handy in case you may be cornered. To defeat him, run 
in, uppercut, jump kick to the face, and jump away, then repeat. If he is at the 
center of the room, you may also use the switch at the right end of the room to 
drop the raised platform down on him.<br>
<br>

<u><b><a href="#TOP" name="L4">Level 4: The Water Element</a></b></u><br>
<a href="pics/map_level4.gif" target="blank">
<img alt="Klick Me For Larger Image" border="0" height="522" src="pics/map_level4.gif" title="Klick Me For Larger Image" width="773"></a><br>
<br>
Start off by going to your right. Jump on the rope and then jump across to the right. 
Fight the monk that is waiting. Take the herbal healer. Jump on the rope and go 
up to the next level. Go your the right and fight the monk. Go to the next rope 
and take it all the way to the top. Go right and jump on the next rope. Climb it 
to the top and go left. Take the key (check point).<br>
<br>
Now, go back down the rope. Go left and then down the rope to the bottom. Go left 
and fight a monk (sometimes he's not there). Then go down the rope to the first 
opening. Go left (watch out for the electric eels). Then go down the rope to the 
bottom and go left. Fight the monk. Use the key to open the door, then go in. Jump 
on the platform in the middle of the room. Wait as the room fills with water. When 
you float all the way to the left, jump off into the opening. Take the key (check 
point).<br>
<br>
Get back on the platform and ride it back to the bottom as the room drains. Then 
go right out the door and up the rope. Go to your right (watch for the eels again). 
Climb the rope. Go right and climb the next rope. Go right from there and climb 
the next rope up to the first opening. Go right. (This part is tricky!). Before 
using the key to open the door, face left. As soon as you open the door, run left 
(the room is filling with water). Just before you get to the door, perform Subbie's 
slide (the door is quickly coming down!!). Make sure you catch the rope after sliding 
out the door. You will then see a cinematic showing water draining into another 
room).<br>
<br>
Now, go down the rope. Go back to your left and down that rope. Go left at the first 
opening. Then go down the first rope to the first opening and go right. Wait for 
the floating platform and jump on it and ride to the other side. Jump right, into 
the opening. Jump from platform to platform to avoid the eels. At the far right 
take the key (check point).<br>
<br>
Now go left and back across the water on the floating platform. Fight the monk and 
then go left. Take the rope down to the bottom and go right. Wait for the floating 
platform. Ride it across jumping over the pipes as you get to them (take the formula). 
Then go right and climb the rope. Go right and fight the monk. Continue right and 
use your key to open the door, walk in!!<br>
<br>
Now, you must fight the Water God. Use you freezing ability along with combos to 
do major damage (use your block button wisely to avoid his projectiles). When you 
beat him he will explode (in a Shao Khan way). Then you vaporize again and reappear 
in the stinking bowels of hell!<br>
<br>
<b>Floatation Devices:</b> Use the wooden barrels floating in deep pools of water 
to get safely to the other side. Time your jump to get on one and be sure to control 
the velocity of your jump.<br>
<br>
<b>Triangle Key Area:</b> In the area where you use the triangle key, be ready to 
run out right after you use it. Water will begin to fill the area and the door will 
begin to close, slide to get through the door before it closes, you will automatically 
hang onto the rope right outside.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Water God Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_4god_water.jpg" title="Water God Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - God of Water:</b> The God of Water is fairly simple, but be ready with 
herbs. Freezes, uppercuts, and combos work well on him.<br>
<br>
<a href="#TOP">Return To Top</a><hr class="main">

<u><b><a href="#TOP" name="L5">Level 5: The Fire Element</a></b></u><br>
<br>
Start by grabbing the potion, then go right. Watch out for the really quick monk 
(sweeps work good against these lightning fast Buddhists). Then go right. Beat the 
big monk and continue right. Jump the first fire pit and grab the urn of vitality, 
then jump the next fire pit. Jump up on the 2nd platform and grab the herbal healer. 
Then jump back down to the left on the first platform. Pull the skull switch and 
then quickly go right across the platforms and jump on the one that's moving up. 
Grab the key (check point).<br>
<br>
Go right into the building and jump across the fire pits (watch for the spiked logs). 
Continue right and fight the quick monk. Then go right and fight the big monk. Continue 
right into the building and fight another quick monk. Jump the fire pits and fight 
a big monk; continue right. Climb down the rope and go left over the fire pits. 
Grab the herbal healer and the shield of invincibility. Climb down the rope and 
go left. At the far left, grab the key (check point).<br>
<br>
Go right and grab the urn. Go back up the rope and go right over the fire pits. 
Climb that rope and go right. Jump on the chained platform and go across all three 
(there is an urn on the last one). Go right into the building, there is a big monk 
waiting, beat him. Go right across these dangerous fire pits and grab the eye of 
invisibility. Go up the rope and go right. Jump the fire pits then beat the big 
monk. Go right out on the bridge and fight another big monk. Continue right across 
the fire pits and out on a platform. Cross the platforms and go into the building 
and beat the quick monk. (This next part is tricky). Pull the skull switch and then 
hurry back across the platforms and into the bottom opening. Go left and grab the 
key (check point).<br>
<br>
Now, pull the skull switch and run back across the platforms and jump on the last 
one (be quick, because it is on the rise). Ride it up and go right into the building 
and fight the quick monk. Then go right and use any key to open the door (you must 
have all 3 in order to get in). There you will meet the Fire God. It doesn't seem 
as though you are able to freeze him, so use your skills as a fighter to defeat 
the Fire God. He will explode when you beat him, and you are treated with a cinematic 
starring Sub-Zero, Quan Chi, plus a guest appearance by Raiden! Now off to the Prison 
of Souls!!!!! (but only if you are on at least the normal level).<br>
<br>
<b>Platforms:</b> There are a lot of switch-controlled platforms in this level. 
When you hit a switch, you have to get from that end of the area to the other as 
quickly as possible to reach the platform that has been lowered before it returns 
to its neutral position.<br>
<br>
<img alt="God of Fire Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_5god_fire.jpg" title="God of Fire Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - God of Fire:</b> The God of Fire can't be frozen. Use combos often to 
defeat him.<br>
<br>
<a href="#TOP">Return To Top</a><hr class="main">

<u><b><a href="#TOP" name="L6">Level 6: The Prison of Souls</a></b></u><br>
<br>
Sub-Zero will jump out of the portal that Raiden created. Quan Chi is there for 
a split second, then he vanishes. Go right and out the door. There waiting will 
be a guard. (these guards have staffs that shoot lasers and are much harder to beat). 
After you beat the guard, go right. Take the potion and fight another guard. Wait 
for a third guard to show up, then beat him. Jump past the first mallet. Then jump 
past the next one and kick the guard on the way down. (hopefully the mallet will 
crush him, but if not, beat him). Jump past the last mallet and go right. Beat one 
more guard and grab the herbs. Go into the door. (check point).<br>
<br>
Fight the two unarmed guards that are in the room. Go right and out the door. Outside 
there is a guard with a laser staff, beat him. Go right and wait for the electric 
fence to stop, then jump over it. Fight the next guard and jump over the last electric 
fence. Grab the herbs and go right. Sub-Zero will start running and will get beat 
down by two guards and a huge guard with a saw blade for an arm. You will now see 
a cinematic with Sub-Zero in prison with Shinnok! <br>
<br>
Now the quest continues. Go right and out the door. When the door opens there is 
a guard waiting for you that has a large laser cannon, beat him. Go right across 
the platforms and face off with another cannon packing guard. Continue right. Drop 
down on the first platform and grab the herbs. Then jump up on the platform to the 
right and jump past the large mallets. Fight the guard that's waiting. Now you have 
to make a big jump to your right to the next platform. Beat the guard that is there 
and take the Level 1 key. (check point).<br>
<br>
Make the big jump back to the platform to your left. Stand on the elevator. Hold 
the use button and hit HK to activate the elevator. Take it up to Level 1. Go right 
and beat the guard. Grab the herbs and continue right. At the far right of the platform 
you will find the Level 2 key, take it. (check point).<br>
<br>
Jump right to the elevator and take it up to Level 2. Now you must face off against 
the huge guard with the saw blade on his arm!! Use the Dit Dow Formula (and any 
other resources that you may need) so you won't take as much damage.<br>
<br>
TIP: Run up to him and hit HK then immediately slide between his legs, do this until 
he goes down. Once you beat him, grab the Level 3 key and go back left. Jump on 
the elevator and then jump across to the platform on the left. Go left and take 
the elevator down. (hold the use button and hit LP). Continue left past the large 
mallets until you get to the next elevator. Take it all the way to the top, then 
go right to the next elevator (you may have to fight some guards on the way). Take 
the elevator up the Level 3. Beat the guard to your left and take the Urn of Strength. 
Go back down and go right. Continue until you get back to where you fought the huge &quot;saw 
blade&quot; guard. Jump on the elevator at the right and take it up to Level 3. 
Go right to the end of the platform. Use the Urn of Strength, and jump kick the 
large statue on the right. It will fall over and Sub-Zero will run up it. Now, prepare 
to be treated to a great cinematic!<br>
<br>
<b>
<img alt="Scorpion Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_6scorpion.jpg" title="Scorpion Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
Scorpion Reincarnated:</b> After you get past the beginning part of this level, 
the Executioner Bot will attack you and guards will beat you and throw you in a 
cell. You will then encounter either Shinnok himself or a reincarnated Scorpion. 
If you talk to Shinnok, you won't have to fight him (at least in this level). However, 
if you are confronted by Scorpion in the cell, you will have to do battle with the 
specter. To defeat him here, just use freezes, uppercuts, and combos, they all work 
fine.<br>
<br>
<b>Cannon Guards:</b> The guards carrying cannons can be a pain. When their projectiles 
are heard coming, duck until you see it go past. Sliding by then should reach far 
enough to reach the guard and cause him to drop his weapon (unless you're at the 
edge of a platform of course, in which case you should just carefully time your 
jump). Without their cannon, these guards are nothing more than another common enemy 
in this level.<br>
<br>
<b>Elevators:</b> The elevators can only go to a certain level by the use of a key 
for that particular level. When you have the key for the destination, operate an 
elevator by holding the USE button and pressing High Kick to go up, or Low Punch 
to go down.<br>
<br>
<b>BOSS - The Executioner Bot:</b> Soon, you will face the Executioner Bot. If he 
corners you, try to slide under him (you'll go past as long as he isn't standing 
ready. ie. if he's attacking. Otherwise, he will kick you before you get through). 
To defeat him, run in, roundhouse, jump kick to the head, and jump away, repeat.<br>
<br>
<b>Shinnok's Statue:</b> After you defeat the Executioner Bot and get the key to 
the 3rd level, go left to find an elevator that leads up to a small platform on 
the 3rd. There, you will find an urn that can give you superhuman strength. Go back 
to the end of the stage until you reach the large statue of Shinnok, and use the 
urn. You'll then have the strength to knock the statue down with a simple jump kick.<br>

<u><b><a href="#TOP" name="L7">Level 7: The Bridge of Immortality</a></b></u><br>
<br>
Go right and fight the three guards. Go to the end of the platform and jump down 
to the lower level. Go the left and jump to the next platform. Then continue left 
down to the next platform. Go right to the platform underneath. Continue right across 
the platforms until it looks like you can't go any further. Drop down and go left. 
Continue jumping across the platforms to your left. You will now face the first 
Bridge Keeper. Once you beat him, grab the key (check point).<br>
<br>
TIP: Jump kicks are very effective.<br>
<br>
Go back right and all the way up to the top. Go right to the next platform and grab 
the potion and the herbs. Jump to the next platform. Now you must face off against 
the second Bridge Keeper. When you have defeated him, grab the key (check point).<br>
<br>
TIP: Use the same method that you used on the &quot;saw blade&quot; guard to beat 
him.<br>
<br>
Go right and drop down to the small platform directly underneath and grab the potion. 
Now, go right, make sure to completely clear these swinging blades when you are 
jumping. Jump to the next platform and fight the guard. Jump to the next platform 
on your right and then up to the next one. (I have not figured out how to get on 
the higher platforms on the left). Now, it is time to face off with the third Bridge 
Keeper. (This one is tougher than the previous ones, so use your resources wisely). 
When you beat him, all you get is an Urn of Vitality, but never the less, grab it. 
(check point).<br>
<br>
Go right and jump to the lower platform (be careful of the two guards, they will 
gang up on you). Beat them and then go right to the small platform and drop down. 
You will meet the fourth and final Bridge Keeper there. (He fights the same as the 
second Bridge Keeper). When you finish him off, you will see that final key, grab 
it. Now you have all three of the Fortress Icons, onward to Shinnok's Fortress. 
(check point).<br>
<br>
Go to your right and jump on the platform. Ride it up and go right. Jump to the 
small platform, then jump to the next one (when you land, run and jump to the next 
platform quickly; you will see why). Jump to the next platform and then do the same 
thing again. When you jump up to the next platform, there are two armed guards waiting. 
Do the Super Slide to disarm them, then beat them. Continue right and fight the 
next guard. Jump over the first two sets of swinging axes and duck until the guard 
takes a break from shooting. Jump across the next swinging ax and beat the guard. 
Continue right. Jump across to the next platform and beat the guard that is waiting. 
Jump over the next three sets of swinging axes and then over to the next platform. 
Finish off the last guard that is waiting and go to the far right. You are now at 
Shinnok's Fortress. Use a key to enter. (you must have all three or you will not 
be able to go in).<br>

<b>BOSS - Robots:</b> There are three Bots in this level, two of which are carrying 
keys. They can all be defeated using a jump in, roundhouse, jump kick to head, jump 
away, and repeat pattern. The reason it is necessary to jump in instead of running 
in for the Chain Gun Bot is because his bullets will hit you if you remain grounded 
on your way in.<br>
<br>

<b>BOSS - Dinosaur:</b> The dinosaur is as hard to defeat as he may have been for 
you to find. He breathes fire, head butts, and his extremely dangerous. Have lots 
of herbs ready, there is no way to avoid energy loss when fighting this little monster. 
One way to defeat him with as little damage as possible would be to give him a jump 
kick to the head, duck, and repeat.<br>

<br>
You will now use Quan Chi's teleporter. You are treated to a short cinematic, then 
you square off against Quan Chi (but you are not alone!). With Quan Chi defeated, 
it is time for Shinnok to finally step in.<br>
<br>
Now face off against Shinnok!<br>
<br>
TIP: When Shinnok is about to shoot a fireball, freeze him. Then run and teleport 
behind him and freeze him again. Run up to him and take his amulet!!<br>
<br>
Then you will see him morph into a giant demon, run through the portal that appears 
on the bridge and when you cross it Raiden will be waiting.....<br>
<br>
<img alt="Kia Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_8kia.jpg" title="Kia Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - Kia:</b> Weapon: Boomerang Blades. The first two of Quan Chi's female 
assassins can be defeated using freezes, uppercuts, slides, combos, and well-timed 
throws, but they can also be extremely dangerous.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Jataaka Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_8jataaka.jpg" title="Jataaka Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - Jataaka:</b> Weapon: Laser sword which fires blue bolts of energy. The 
first two of Quan Chi's female assassins can be defeated using freezes, uppercuts, 
slides, combos, and well-timed throws, but they can also be extremely dangerous.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Sareena Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_8sareena.jpg" title="Sareena Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - Sareena:</b> The third of Quan Chi's three assassins uses a hook sword 
and is just as quick as her partners. She can also be defeated using freezes, uppercuts, 
slides, combos, and throws. When you defeat her, you will be given the chance to 
finish her off with your <a href="controls.htm#FAT">Fatality</a>, (F, D, F, <b>HP</b>) 
but if you do, it will be to your own disadvantage later on.<br>
<br>
<b>Quan Chi's Teleporter:</b> Once you have defeated all three of Quan Chi's female 
assassins and have gotten their crystals, place them at the three outdoor areas 
of the fortress at its highest peak. You must place the eastern and western ones 
first, they point toward the center. Now use the center one, which points upward. 
You will then be teleported into Quan Chi's sanctuary.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Quan Chi Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_8quanchi.jpg" title="Quan Chi Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - Quan Chi:</b> Quan Chi is the sub boss of MKMS. Freeze him when he tries 
to pull you in. Use uppercuts, slides, and combos to defeat him. Avoid trying to 
throw him unless he's frozen (in which case an uppercut would be more damaging anyhow). 
Have some herbs handy too. If you killed Sareena earlier in this level, you will 
have to defeat Quan Chi yourself. However, if you have spared her life, she will 
use the teleporter when Quan Chi has around 10% energy left and uppercut him with 
her hook sword into the pit.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Shinnok Boss Fight" border="0" height="225" src="pics/boss_8shinnok.jpg" title="Shinnok Boss Fight" width="300"><br>
<b>BOSS - Shinnok:</b> The fallen elder god Shinnok will be your final challenge 
in MKMS. With the power of the amulet, he is protected by a force field. To defeat 
him, you must first get behind him with him frozen, there are two ways to do so: 
1) Time an ice blast to hit him right when he fires a projectile in order to freeze 
him (the amulet can't be used for his force field at the same time as power for 
a projectile). When he's frozen, use the teleporter at the side of the room. 2) 
Keep jumping at him, bouncing off of the force field repeatedly until he fires a 
projectile (it doesn't harm you, just keeps you away). When he does, you will jump 
right past him. Now freeze him before he turns around. Once you are standing behind 
him with him frozen, simply walk up to him and press the <b>USE</b> button to grab 
his amulet.<br>
