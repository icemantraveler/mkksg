<a name="aquaman" href="#top">
<img title="Aquaman" src="bio_aquaman.jpg" border="1" alt="Aquaman" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Aquaman</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Victory over Superman&nbsp;was only the beginning of Aquaman's rise to power. Uniting 
the world's oceans under the banner of Atlantis,&nbsp;Aquaman had a controlling 
interest in the planet's ecology--and economy. His influence did not escape the 
attention of the world's multinational corporations, who looked to end his 
reign. Villains lured by the promise of big money to assassinate the King of 
Atlantis pursued him relentlessly. But Aquaman's popularity served him well. The 
world's citizens rose up in anger against those who would quell Aquaman's 
influence. The threat abated, a groundswell of support began for a United Earth 
under Aquaman's command. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="ares" href="#top">
<img title="Ares" src="bio_ares.jpg" border="1" alt="Ares" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Ares</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Superman's defeat did not work to Ares' advantage as he had planned. The heroes 
of the parallel dimension helped this world's Batman&nbsp;build a conflict-free 
Utopia that left the war god famished. On the brink of death, Ares managed to 
imprison Brainiac 5. He forced Brainiac to create a time loop beginning with the 
other dimensional heroes' arrival and ending just before their victory. In this 
pocket of time, Ares flourished. Endless war was his to savor.
<hr color="#333333">
<a name="Bane" href="#top">
<img title="Bane" src="bio_bane.jpg" border="1" alt="Bane" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Bane</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Superman had been a fool to believe Bane would willingly accept a subordinate 
role in the One Earth Government. With the high councilor out of the way, true 
leadership could begin. Bane found Sinestro and Black Adam inspiring examples of 
ruthless absolute authority. They reciprocated his regards for their talents. 
The three former villains regained control of the planet, and formed a ruling 
triad that would be uninterrupted, until the next phase of Bane's plan.
<hr color="#333333">
<a name="batman" href="#top">
<img title="Batman" src="bio_batman.jpg" border="1" alt="Batman" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Batman</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Following the battle to liberate Earth, Batman learned that Luthor had 
bequeathed his massive fortune to Bruce Wayne. He now had the means to rebuild 
Gotham and Metropolis. The cities' residents, inspired by their hero's efforts, 
adopted the slogan &quot;We Are Batman.&quot; They contributed countless hours to their 
communities' renovation--and crime prevention. The Batman of old would have 
stubbornly assumed these tasks alone; the post-One Earth Batman, having been 
rewarded for his trust in others, enjoyed his city's renewal and his role as its 
benefactor. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="blackadam" href="#top">
<img title="Black Adam" src="bio_blackadam.jpg" border="1" alt="Black Adam" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Black Adam</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
The defeat of Superman&nbsp;taught Black Adam one thing: most of Earth's denizens 
were too weak to adopt Kahndaq's visionary form of government. He returned to 
his homeland with a new plan. Combining their energies, Black Adam and his 
empress, Isis, created a mystical barrier around Kahndaq. There they reigned in 
peace, their country an oasis in the wasteland of human civilization--a true 
oasis once Black Adam had destroyed all other life on Earth. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="catwoman" href="#top">
<img title="Catwoman" src="bio_catwoman.jpg" border="1" alt="Catwoman" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Catwoman</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
At last, Superman&nbsp;had paid for what he had done to Catwoman. Feigning allegiance 
to his regime had cost Selina her beloved Batman--and her best chance at 
happiness. Pride and anger kept her from attempting reconciliation with Bruce 
Wayne. But his inspiring reconstruction of Gotham and Metropolis&nbsp;fostered in her 
a desire to remain close to him. Until she was ready to approach him again, she 
did her part to keep Gotham's streets clear of crime. Nascent underworld 
organizations had both The Bat and The Cat to fear. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="cyborg" href="#top">
<img title="Cyborg" src="bio_cyborg.jpg" border="1" alt="Cyborg" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Cyborg</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
After Superman's defeat, Cyborg led the assault on the Fortress of Solitude&nbsp;to 
flush out remnants of the High Councilor's regime. The Fortress was well 
defended, the battle intense. Cyborg was forced to use unfamiliar Kryptonian 
tools to make repairs to his damaged cybernetics. Enhanced with the alien 
technology, Cyborg found he could communicate with Superman's androids and order 
them to apprehend the opposition. With his army of super androids, Cyborg will 
bring justice to the world. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="deathstroke" href="#top">
<img title="Deathstroke" src="bio_deathstroke.jpg" border="1" alt="Deathstroke" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Deathstroke</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
With Superman's Regime toppled, new governments formed to take its place. New 
governments meant new customers for Deathstroke, and business was booming. Soon, 
there were more assassinations to carry out, revolutions to aid, and unrest to 
create than he could manage on his own. The One Earth Regime's Elite Troopers 
having committed atrocities in Superman's name, had gone into hiding from a 
populous bent on revenge. Impossible for most to find, but not for Deathstroke. 
Recruiting these renegades, he formed the new Titans, the world's premiere 
political assassins. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="doomsday" href="#top">
<img title="Doomsday" src="bio_doomsday.jpg" border="1" alt="Doomsday" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Doomsday</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Free of Superman's control, Doomsday eradicated the remaining meta-humans. He 
then manipulated technology in the abandoned Fortress of Solitude&nbsp;to terraform 
the Earth. It soon resembled prehistoric Krypton. At last it felt like home. 
After a few years of exterminating humanity at his leisure, however, Doomsday 
needed a challenge. Having assimilated Superman's ability to fly, he headed for 
a nearby space sector. He had heard rumors of an opponent worthy of his 
attention: a Czarnian mercenary with a taste for violence. Doomsday was eager to 
meet this &quot;Lobo&quot; in battle. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="flash" href="#top">
<img title="The Flash" src="bio_flash.jpg" border="1" alt="The Flash" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>The Flash</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Flash had taken down the High Councilor, but the atrocities he had abetted 
during Superman's regime continued to haunt him. His shame eventually drove him 
into exile. Whether wishing to make further amends or simply unable to stop 
himself, Flash continued to use his powers in the pursuit of justice. Rumors of 
a mysterious red streak of energy that would set upon and incapacitate criminals 
circulated throughout Central City. While only some deduced his true name, most 
felt gratitude and affection for the new hero they called The Ghost.
<hr color="#333333">
<a name="greenarrow" href="#top">
<img title="Green Arrow" src="bio_greenarrow.jpg" border="1" alt="Green Arrow" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Green Arrow</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
After defeating Superman, Green Arrow visits his counter-part's home, Star City. 
Upon his arrival, he discovers that his parallel counterpart was one of the 
first to fall in the battle against Superman's regime. As a result, a memorial 
was erected in his honor as a reminder to always fight oppression in all its 
forms. Finding a like-minded individual in the parallel Earth, Roy Harper, who 
Green Arrow promptly trained, he allowed him to become the new scarlet-clad 
defender of Star City, Red Arrow. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="greenlantern" href="#top">
<img title="Green Lantern" src="bio_greenlantern.jpg" border="1" alt="Green Lantern" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Green Lantern</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Mere days after returning to his Earth, Green Lantern, in an event mirroring his 
ascension to the Corps, witnessed the crash landing of an alien ship. 
Investigating the wreckage, he encountered the pilot, who claimed to be Abin Sur. 
But this Abin Sur wore no power ring, and referred to him in halting breaths as 
The Almighty One. Green Lantern tried to convince the alien of their past: That 
Abin Sur had named Hal Jordan his successor as the Green Lantern of Sector 2814. 
But the alien died from his wounds before Green Lantern could learn more of him. 
Lantern left immediately for Oa. The Guardians were his only hope of solving 
this mystery. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="harleyquinn" href="#top">
<img title="Harley Quinn" src="bio_harleyquinn.jpg" border="1" alt="Harley Quinn" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Harley Quinn</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
The defeat of Superman filled Harley with confidence. She knew what she was 
capable of, and knew what she wanted. She traveled to the visitors' Earth and 
freed The Joker from prison. Returning to her world, they married in a ceremony 
that set Gotham ablaze. At the reception, the cake cutting ceremony took a 
gruesome turn. As her new husband playfully mashed her face into the cake, years 
of abuse took its toll. Something in Harley snapped. She used the ceremonial 
knife to slash Joker's throat. Still wearing her wedding gown, Harley now 
resides permanently in Arkham Asylum. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="hawkgirl" href="#top">
<img title="Hawkgirl" src="bio_hawkgirl.jpg" border="1" alt="Hawkgirl" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Hawkgirl</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Free of his brainwashing, Hawkgirl exacted revenge on the High Councilor&nbsp;for 
murdering her husband, Hawkman. She was nevertheless sent to prison for her role 
in the regime. One night she awoke hovering above her cot, glowing with eldritch 
light. An instant later she stood at the bottom of a shallow crater. There she 
found the source of the light: a meteorite of pure Nth-metal. As she touched it, 
the meteorite sprung to life, encasing her in Nth-metal. The new armor made 
Hawkgirl invincible. Her first act: vengeance against those who had helped 
Superman capture Hawkman. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="joker" href="#top">
<img title="The Joker" src="bio_joker.jpg" border="1" alt="The Joker" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>The Joker</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Though he had failed to elevate the Joker Clan's status, Joker was convinced a 
similar organization could be successful in his dimension. Joker used a series 
of devastating terrorist acts to frighten the populace, then convinced the more 
gullible among them that he was the path to security. The new Joker Clan soon 
had millions of members worldwide and committed regular anti-government attacks, 
wreaking havoc on the global economy. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="killerfrost" href="#top">
<img title="Killer Frost" src="bio_killerfrost.jpg" border="1" alt="Killer Frost" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Killer Frost</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Killer Frost reveled in her victory--but her overconfidence betrayed her. 
Seizing the opportunity, agents of S.T.A.R. Labs captured her. Their scientists 
harnessed her freezing power in order to fortify the world's polar ice caps. But 
S.T.A.R. Labs underestimated Frost's abilities. Turning on her captors, she 
froze their facility--and eventually the entire Western Hemisphere. The 
survivors now struggle to overthrow the self-proclaimed Ice Queen.
<hr color="#333333">
<a name="lexluthor" href="#top">
<img title="Lex Luthor" src="bio_lexluthor.jpg" border="1" alt="Lex Luthor" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Lex Luthor</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
A win against this world's Superman&nbsp;was greatly satisfying. But its aftermath 
would be sweeter still. Luthor had traveled to this dimension to convince its 
residents that he was their Luthor, who had miraculously survived the High 
Councilor's globally televised attack on him. Beloved before, the triumphant 
Luthor was now worshipped. He was elected President of the United States--but 
soon looked to further consolidate his power. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="nightwing" href="#top">
<img title="Nightwing" src="bio_nightwing.jpg" border="1" alt="Nightwing" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Nightwing</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Nightwing had beaten his former boss Superman in single combat, not even Batman 
had done that. his thirst for conflict grew. he began challenging anyone who 
crossed his past. Nightwing's belligerence eventually drew the attention of 
Sinestro. his core was always in need of new recruits, and the young human 
seemed able to inspired great fear. Sinestro had his suspicions confirmed when a 
yellow power ring found it's way onto Nightwing's finger. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="raven" href="#top">
<img title="Raven" src="bio_raven.jpg" border="1" alt="Raven" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Raven</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Winning the battle with Superman cost Raven dearly. The amount of demonic energy 
required overwhelmed her. After regaining consciousness, she looked around 
warily. Her immediate surroundings were a hellish ruin. Nearby stood her father, 
Trigon. Raven had somehow called him forth during her battle. Trigon thanked his 
daughter. He then summoned an army of demons and set out to destroy the rest of 
the planet. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="shazam" href="#top">
<img title="SHAZAM!" src="bio_shazam.jpg" border="1" alt="SHAZAM!" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>SHAZAM!</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Following the events in the parallel dimension, Shazam's fellow heroes returned 
home. But an alien virus contracted during the transfer created in them acute 
mental instability. They turned on their fellow crime fighters in a deranged 
fury. Alone and desperate, Shazam shared the power of the Word with his adopted 
brothers and sisters. Their purity of heart gave them courage. The Army of 
Shazam incapacitated the former heroes. Eventually they took the place of the 
Justice League as primary defenders of Earth. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="sinestro" href="#top">
<img title="Sinestro" src="bio_sinestro.jpg" border="1" alt="Sinestro" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Sinestro</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
When Superman's&nbsp;One Earth regime proved to be a failure similar to his at 
Korugar, Sinestro retreated to deep space to ruminate on its demise. Fear had 
long seemed the most powerful of the emotions with which to bring order to the 
universe. Yet it had not been enough. Desperate, Sinestro hurled the might of 
the Sinestro Corps against The Life Entity, keeper of the White Power Battery. 
Ultimately victorious, Sinestro now wielded the power of a White Lantern. No 
adversary could possibly withstand him. The light of the Green Lantern Corps 
would be the first he would extinguish. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="solomongrundy" href="#top">
<img title="Solomon Grundy" src="bio_solomongrundy.jpg" border="1" alt="Solomon Grundy" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Solomon Grundy</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
The battle over, Grundy eluded capture and returned to his swamp to heal his 
wounds. During regeneration, Grundy found he could channel the elemental force 
of The Red. All animal life would bend to his rule. His increased power also 
allowed him to resurrect the long-last Grey force. Now instead of ruling Earth's 
creatures, he could simply destroy them. After defeating the world's heroes, 
Grundy turned Earth into his version of paradise. He now rules over a grey and 
lifeless planet. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="superman" href="#top">
<img title="Superman" src="bio_superman.jpg" border="1" alt="Superman" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Superman</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Though pleased with the outcome, Superman's battle with his duplicate left him 
troubled. If one Superman could go so far astray, why not another? Preventative 
measures were in order. After much discussion with his fellow Justice Leaguers, 
Superman ingested a remote-release Kryptonite capsule. At any sign of 
instability, the Kryptonite would permeate his body, killing him. The question 
of who could trigger the device was solved democratically. Each week a different 
Leaguer would take possession of its remote control. Only Batman was denied a 
shift. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="wonderwoman" href="#top">
<img title="Wonder Woman" src="bio_wonderwoman.jpg" border="1" alt="Wonder Woman" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Wonder Woman</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Wonder Woman returned home to find her dimension in ruins. Aware of Superman's 
despotic rule of the parallel dimension, the gods of Olympus vowed to 
preemptively eliminate the meta-human scourge from their world. Under the 
direction of Zeus, they hunted down and eliminated nearly all super-powered 
mortals. All that remained to oppose them was Themyscira. Wonder Woman and her 
Amazons fought back against the Olympians with unrelenting courage. Despite 
heavy losses, Wonder Woman's forces ultimately prevailed. They took reign as the 
New Olympians, ushering in an age of peace and prosperity. <hr color="#333333">

<b>Lobo</b> (DLC#1)<hr color="#1A1A1A">
There was no shortage of vendettas during Superman's reign and no shortage of 
bounties for Lobo to collect. He became one of the richest men in the universe, 
assassinating those who ran a foul of the high counselor. Lobo's already massive 
ego inflated along with his rising wealth. Lobo searched for an assignment of 
his abilities with so many super powered beings dead at his hand. However 
bounties were scarce. Lobo decided to use his wealth to make an alternate 
contract, he would kill the citizens of New Genesis, home of the new gods.

<b>Batgirl</b> (DLC#2)<hr color="#1A1A1A">
Not all heroes were destroyed by Superman; some were actually created by him. A 
technology wizard, Barbara Gordon had eluded detection by One Earth 
intelligence, feeding information to the insurgency under the code name 
&quot;Oracle&quot;. But after the regime's murder of her father, Gotham Police 
Commissioner James Gordon, Barbara channeled her anger into a new alter-ego. 
Sensing the right opportunity to strike, she attacked Superman directly. By 
defeating the High Councilor, she had announced Batgirl to the world in an 
impressive fashion. <hr color="#333333">
<a name="DLC3" href="#top">
<img title="Scorpion" src="bio_scorpion.jpg" border="1" alt="Scorpion" width="75" height="75"></a>
<b>Scorpion</b> (DLC#3)<hr color="#1A1A1A">
The fool in the red cape had been dealt with. Now Scorpion would learn how he 
came to this place. Heretofore, only the sorcerer Quan Chi or the fallen Elder 
God, Shinnok, could have summoned him. Scorpion's answers appeared in the form 
of Trigon, who accused Scorpion of deserting Trigon's demon army and stealing 
from him the glory of besting the High Councilor. The two faced each other in a 
titanic struggle. Scorpion emerged the victor and assumed control of Trigon's 
invasion force. Soon this strange new land would be his to rule.

<b>General Zod</b> (DLC#4)<hr color="#1A1A1A">
Free of the Phantom Zone at last, Zod's first order of business, Superman's 
defeat, had been accomplished. Now his revenge could be fully realized. His time 
in the Phantom Zone had allowed Zod to learn its secrets, he had even learned 
from one of his fellow residents how to call forth small pockets at will. After 
introducing Superman to its mind-numbing emptiness, Zod claimed the High 
Councillorship and began to rebuild Earth in the image of mighty Krypton...

<b>Martian Manhunter</b> (DLC#5)<hr color="#1A1A1A">
Banishing his friend and former teammate Superman to the Phantom Zone was 
difficult for J'onn J'onzz, but necessary. As the One Earth Regime had formed, 
J'onn, ever the outsider, had chosen to watch from a distance to bide his time. 
He assumed the form of an Atlantean, and served as royal archivist. Aquaman 
little suspected that his trusted subject's uncanny ability to gather news of 
the surface world was the result of telepathic powers. When J'onn learned that 
heroes from a parallel dimension were aiding Batman's Insurgency, he assisted as 
well, leading rescue operations in Metropolis and Gotham after Superman's 
rampage. In the post Regime era, the Martian Manhunter continued to serve his 
adopted world, gathering the next generation of heroes to form a new Justice

The defeat of Superman was a relief to Zatanna. During the Regime she and Doctor 
Fate had taken advantage of Superman's vulnerability to magic and turned the 
Tower of Fate into a sanctuary for Superman's enemies. She had saved many lives, 
but years of subterfuge weighed heavily upon her. After the Regime's downfall, 
Zatanna was instrumental in restraining meta-humans during their trials, but 
when a jury recommended the death penalty for the more immutable defendants, 
Zatanna intervened. She took the prisoners to the Tower of Fate. There they 
would remain-incarcerated, but alive. <hr color="#333333">
