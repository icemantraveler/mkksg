<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
In a shadowy throne room, Baraka approaches Quan Chi, questioning the sorcerer's desire for power when the realm is empty. Quan Chi assures him that the war was never about ruling mortals, but obtaining ultimate power. Baraka, growing frustrated, draws his 
blades and strikes, believing he's finally defeated his ally.<br>
However, Baraka is shocked to find that the figure on the throne is only a skeleton. The real Quan Chi appears behind him, mocking his foolishness. Before Baraka can react, Quan Chi freezes him mid-air with a blast of energy. Laughing, he raises his hand, 
disintegrating Baraka in an instant.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Quan Chi: &quot;Enter!&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;I said enter, Baraka. Have no fear. Our betrayal is complete. I have dealt with those once loyal to Shinnok. This victory is ours!&quot;<br>
<br>
Baraka: &quot;You bask in your newfound power on the throne of Queen Sindel, while I am forced to hide in the shadows?&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;Who is it you are hiding from? The Elder Gods are dead. Raiden is dead, and thanks to you, Shinnok is dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
Baraka: &quot;Everyone is dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;Yes. Everyone in this forsaken realm is dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
Baraka: &quot;How do we rule a realm with no one in it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;This war was not about holding court to mortals. It was about obtaining power! I now possess that power!&quot;<br>
<br>
Baraka: &quot;And I am forced to live out my existence in a dead realm with a madman!&quot;<br>
<br>
Baraka: &quot;Now, sorcerer, you will pay with your life!&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;I haven't a life to give, you fool.&quot;<br>

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
In a high-tech lab, Cyrax, surrounded by Sonya and Jax, undergoes a risky procedure to revert back to his human form, longing to recover the life he once had. Despite the danger, he insists on going through with it, believing his existence means nothing without 
his human psyche.<br>
After the process is completed, Cyrax removes his helmet, revealing his true face for the first time in years. Grateful and fully human again, he thanks Sonya and Jax for their help. Rejecting his Lin Kuei past, he vows to fight alongside them for Earth, leaving 
his former life as an assassin behind.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Sonya: &quot;Alright, Cyrax, all systems are go. Are you sure you want to go through with this? If this fails, we won't be able to recover your main processor.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jax: &quot;We'll loose you for good.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyrax: &quot;After experiencing the flashbacks of my fight against Shinnok, I realize that my existence is unnecessary, unless I can fully recover my human psyche. We must continue with the process.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jax: &quot;All right, then. I'll begin the scanning process. Sonya, you hit the regeneration switch on my cue.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sonya: &quot;All set, Jax. Ready on your go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jax: &quot;Sonya, hit the switch on three. Ready? One. Two. Three!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jax: &quot;Okay. Power down now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sonya: &quot;Powering down.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyrax: &quot;I... I am human. I feel life once again, and I remember everything. Thank you so much. I am forever in your debt. I will not return to my Lin Kuei roots as an assassin. I instead choose to fight at your side, for Earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jax: &quot;Well, that's good news.&quot;<br>

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
In a grand throne room, Kitana sits in quiet contemplation when her synthetic sister, Mileena, bursts in, demanding the throne. Kitana firmly rejects her, reminding Mileena of her creation through dark sorcery. Mileena, enraged, vows to take the throne for 
herself, but Kitana remains resolute.<br>
With a cold, calm motion, Kitana presses a button hidden in her throne, triggering a trapdoor beneath Mileena. As her sister falls away, Kitana watches silently, knowing that peace has come at last. With Mileena gone, Kitana now rules Edenia, free from the 
chaos that once threatened her realm.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Mileena: &quot;Kitana, I want your status. I want to be Princess of Edenia. It is my right!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kitana: &quot;You have no right! You are not my sister! You were born of Shang Tsung's sorcery for Shao Kahn. What right do you have to the throne of Edenia!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mileena: &quot;No. No!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kitana: &quot;You are evil, and have no place in this world!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mileena: &quot;You are right, Kitana, but if I have no right to his realm... then<br>
neither will you!&quot;<br>

Mileena: &quot;You will die, sister, and I will take this realm for myself!&quot;<br>

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
In a grand hall, Kitana and Goro discuss a peace treaty with the Centaurs. Goro agrees to the truce, knowing it will bring prosperity to Earthrealm and beyond. Kitana expresses her gratitude, but their peaceful moment is interrupted when Kung Lao's razor hat 
slices through the air, striking Goro.<br>
Kung Lao descends, challenging Goro but seeking peace, not conflict. He explains the strike was born of vengeance for his fallen ancestor, and after a brief exchange, Goro acknowledges the honor in Kung Lao's actions. The two warriors shake hands, united in 
a newfound understanding, putting aside their differences for the good of all realms.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Kitana: &quot;Goro, we are here to offer the Shokan a treaty for truce. The Centaurs have already signed and agreed to all terms. We now await your acceptance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Goro: &quot;War has been waged in this realm for too long. We must bring it to an end. I will set aside my differences with the Centaurs as long as they abide by the treaty. I shall sign your agreement.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kitana: &quot;Goro, this is a great victory for all of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kitana: &quot;Kung Lao, we are at a moment of peace! How can you attack now?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kung Lao: &quot;I once thought that an allegiance with an enemy was a lost cause, Princess Kitana.&quot;<br>
<br>
Goro: &quot;Was that your attempt at an assassination, Earth man?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kung Lao: &quot;No, that was a ceremonial strike of revenge for my ancestor that you killed in Mortal Kombat so many years ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
Goro: &quot;And do you wish to continue this battle?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kung Lao: &quot;No, I wish only to settle the differences between us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Goro: &quot;Your ancestor was a great man, and a brave and noble warrior. You should be proud of his accomplishments. If he won, perhaps it would be my own son seeking to settle differences with him.&quot;<hr class="main">

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
In a grand throne room, Mileena demands the throne from Kitana, revealing her desire to rule all realms in Outworld's name. Kitana, unmoved, tells her she's not a true sister, but a creation of Shang Tsung for Shao Kahn. Grief turns to anger as Mileena strikes, 
sending Kitana back into her throne.<br>
Mileena hurls her sais at Kitana, knocking her through the window. As Kitana falls, Mileena stands triumphant, ready to take control of all realms. Her victory is assured as she steps into the role of ruler, determined to claim her place.<hr class="sub">

Fujin vows to protect Earth with patience and wisdom, ensuring the mortals' survival.<br>
As Raiden departs, Fujin pledges to not fail in his new role. Raiden's voice echoes, affirming that Fujin is the right choice to guide Earth through the coming trials, as the Wind God steps into his position as the protector of Earth, prepared to lead against 
the forces of evil.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Fujin: &quot;Our forces of light have defeated Shinnok. Now I must return to my duties as Earth's God of Wind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elder God: &quot;You have served your element well, Fujin, but we have a new mission for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fujin: &quot;Raiden?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raiden: &quot;Our battle with Shinnok's forces is over. I must move on to my new position as an Elder God, and you, Fujin, you must take my former position as protector of Earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fujin: &quot;Raiden, it would be my honor to succeed you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raiden: &quot;Take special care of the mortals of Earth. They are a great people, but have the ability to self destruct. Be patient, and offer your wisdom and guidance.&quot;<br>

and throws her off the cliff with a final, sinister laugh.<br>
Jarek destroys Sonya's radio, mocking her last attempt to reach Jax. As the shattered device falls silent, Jarek walks away, free from the grip of the Special Forces. His laughter echoes, marking the end of their confrontation, as he disappears into the shadows, 
leaving Sonya's fate among the dead.<hr class="sub">

Sonya: &quot;It's over, Jarek! Shinnok is dead. The good guys won. You're coming back with me.&quot;<br>

the cliff's edge.<br>
Jarek pleads for his life, promising to change, but Jax is done listening. He mocks Jarek's cries, explaining that justice isn't about arresting him anymore. With a final, resolute action, Jax lets go, sending Jarek plummeting into the abyss, his screams silenced

tired of his arrogance.<br>
As food and bottles are hurled at him, Johnny tries to defend himself, ranting and calling out his critics. The crowd's hostility intensifies, but Johnny refuses to back down, shouting over the chaos. His once-glamorous moment turns into a chaotic mess, leaving

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
Reiko stands alone in the desolate arena, the last warrior standing. A portal opens, and he steps through, entering a throne room that once belonged to Shao Kahn. As a horned helmet, reminiscent of Kahn's, descends upon his head, Reiko feels a surge of power, 
fueling his ambition.<br>
With a dark smile, Reiko takes his seat upon the throne, embracing his newfound rule over Outworld. He vows to crush any who oppose him, ready to forge his own legacy. Yet, as he settles into power, shadows of betrayal loom, and Reiko prepares for the challenges

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
Reptile kneels before Quan Chi in the hidden depths of his lair, requesting to return to his home world now that the battle is won. He pleads with Shinnok, asking for his wish to be granted.<br>
Quan Chi scoffs at the request, and Reptile grows more insistent. Furious, Shinnok appears, grabbing Reptile by the throat and reminding him of his place. With a cold smirk, Shinnok ends the conversation in a flash, and Reptile's hopes are crushed in an instant.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Reptile: &quot;Quan Chi. I have served our lord Shinnok well in the destruction of Earth's warriors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;Yes. We are most appreciative of your efforts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reptile: &quot;Now I wish to return in time to my home world before it was destroyed at the hands of Shao Kahn. As the new ruler supreme of all reality, Shinnok alone has the power to grant me this wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;You dare make such impetuous requests from your lord and master!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Reptile: &quot;It is a simple request for one of such great power.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;It is also not worth his attention!&quot;<br>
<br>
Reptile: &quot;I demand it! If it were not for warriors such as myself, his attack on Raiden's forces would have failed!&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;Perhaps you could convey your feelings to Shinnok, himself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reptile: &quot;What!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shinnok: &quot;Infidel! You are in no position to demand anything! I could kill you with a mere thought!&quot;<br>
<br>
Reptile: &quot;But, we had a deal!&quot;<br>

Shinnok: &quot;A deal!? I am not a god of my word, Reptile! All deals are off!&quot;<hr class="main">

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
Scorpion stands over Sub-Zero, vengeance in his eyes, thinking his soul will finally be at peace. He believes Sub-Zero's defeat avenges his clan. However, Sub-Zero's final words pierce his heart: the true killer of his family is still free, and his soul will 
never find rest.<br>
As Sub-Zero dies, Scorpion demands answers. From the shadows, Quan Chi reveals himself, claiming he killed Scorpion's clan to use a specter's power against Sub-Zero. He tells Scorpion his service is done, and it's time to return to the Netherrealm. Enraged, 
Scorpion charges, but both are pulled into the Netherrealm.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Scorpion: &quot;By defeating you, Sub-Zero, I have avenged the death of my family and clan. Now my soul can finally rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sub-Zero: &quot;Your soul will never rest, Scorpion. The Lin Kuei may have been responsible for your murder, but your family's true killer still remains free.&quot;<br>
<br>
Scorpion: &quot;If you are not the murderer, then who is?&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;I am the one you seek. To defeat my nemesis Sub-Zero, I needed the power of a specter. You've done my bidding well, Scorpion, but now I must return you to the Netherrealm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Scorpion: &quot;Never!&quot;<br>

<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>
Shinnok hovers above Raiden, his rage fueling his power. He blames the Thunder God for his torment in the Netherrealm for millions of years. With a cruel smirk, Shinnok declares that the mortals of Earth will pay for his suffering, savoring the moment as he 
unleashes his wrath on Raiden.<br>
Raiden protests, calling Shinnok mad for betraying his fellow Elder Gods. Shinnok responds with laughter, declaring his victory as the Elder Gods are no more. He feels the power surging within him, and with a final farewell, he obliterates Raiden, watching 
as the Thunder God is consumed in flames, his screams echoing in the abyss.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Shinnok: &quot;For millions of years, I suffered in the bowels of the Netherrealm. You, Thunder God, are responsible for my suffering. Now, the piteous mortals of Earth will pay for my grievance!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raiden: &quot;You turned against your fellow Elder Gods. You betrayed your title. You deserve much worse!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shinnok: &quot;But it's too late, Raiden. I win! With the Elder Gods out of the way, I will take my rightful place as ruler of all eternity. I can already feel the power surging from within!&quot;<br>

Sonya stands face to face with Jarek at the edge of a cliff, urging him to surrender after Shinnok's defeat. Jarek refuses, charging at her in a last-ditch effort to escape. But in the chaos, he falls off the edge. Sonya contacts Jax, telling him she's returning 
to base, her duty fulfilled.<br>
As she walks away from the cliff, Sonya's expression hardens. Though the mission is complete, the weight of her work never fully lifts. Still, with a brief smile as she hears Jax's voice, she knows the fight against evil will always be waiting.<hr class="sub">

<u><b>Dialogue:</b></u><br>
Sonya: &quot;It's over, Jarek! Shinnok is dead. The good guys won. You're coming back with me.&quot;<br>

Jarek: &quot;Never, Sonya. I agreed to help defeat Shinnok, not turn myself in to the Special Forces. The Black Dragon live on!&quot;<br>

Sub-Zero from certain death.<br>
As Scorpion's fiery attack obliterates the sorcerer, he turns to Sub-Zero, telling him their battle is over. Sub-Zero, now freed from his curse, nods in solemn gratitude. Scorpion leaves him with a final word, urging him to live well, before disappearing into 
the shadows, leaving Sub-Zero to contemplate the uneasy peace that follows.<hr class="sub">

Sub-Zero: &quot;The battle is finished. Your quest for vengeance is over, Scorpion!&quot;<br>

Scorpion: &quot;You cannot kill a dead man. You have defeated my physical form, but my soul is eternal! You will pay for the massacre of my clan and family!&quot;<br>

Quan Chi: &quot;Well done, Sub-Zero. Like your brother before you, you've served my purposes well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sub-Zero: &quot;I serve no one--not the Lin Kuei, and not you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Quan Chi: &quot;Scorpion agreed to fight for us in exchange for freedom from the Netherrealm--a deal I had no intention of fulfilling. By killing him, you've saved us the trouble. Both you and Scorpion were pawns for Shinnok!&quot;<br>

A portal opens, and Shinnok, flanked by Quan Chi, awaits Liu Kang's arrival. Quan Chi mocks him, informing Liu Kang that Earth's warriors are gone and Shinnok reigns supreme. Undeterred, Liu Kang attempts a desperate attack, but Shinnok's blast erupts, destroying 
him. Tanya watches with a sinister smile, the forces of light now extinguished.<hr class="sub">

suddenly bursts in.<br>
Without warning, Sektor launches missiles from his chest, obliterating the lab. Jax and Sonya are caught in the explosion, their bodies lifeless in the debris. In the chaos, Cyrax's restored human head is seen amidst the wreckage, a tragic symbol of the failed
