<img border="1" src="bio_baraka.jpg" alt="Baraka" title="Baraka" width="89" height="82"></a>
<b>Baraka</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Quan Chi is seen in the throne room of the Brotherhood of the Shadow, sifting 
his hands through the lifeless air and flourishing in his own raw sorcery. A 
knock is heard on the gigantic door countless meters away. Quan Chi orders him 
to enter, and we then see it is Baraka who searches Quan Chi. The two then 
converse and embrace as they are planned to rule all realms together, since 
Baraka is the victor of the Tournament. Baraka does not like the idea of having 
a superior, so he lunges into Quan Chi with his long, sharp blades. The blade 
protrudes into the solar plexus of Quan Chi, but the head of Quan Chi becomes, 
oddly, a skull. Baraka soon finds that the real Quan Chi appears behind him. 
Shocked, Baraka leaps again at the real Quan Chi, but is frozen in a maelstrom 
of pure chaos in mid air, and then disintegrated in but a breath.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="cyrax">
<img border="1" src="bio_cyrax.jpg" alt="Cyrax" title="Cyrax" width="89" height="82"></a>
<b>Cyrax</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Cyrax is seen in a laboratory with Sonya and Jax. Sonya and Jax converse with 
him, and reveal that Cyrax plans to revert back to his human form, before he was 
violated into a cyborg by his fellow Lin Kuei. After Sonya and Jax flip a series 
of switches and commands, Cyrax removes his helmet, and is seen to be fully 
human once again. For this, Cyrax now serves the Special Forces.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="kitana">
<img border="1" src="bio_kitana.jpg" alt="Kitana" title="Kitana" width="89" height="82"></a>
<b>Kitana</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Kitana is seen in a gigantic throne room, virtually exactly alike that of Quan 
Chi's throne room. Kitana, sitting in the throne, is interrupted by her 
synthetic sister, Mileena, whom just then entered the room. The two argue, and 
Mileena reveals how she yearns to murder her &quot;sister&quot; and rule all realms for 
her own, and in the name of Outworld. Mileena approaches, ready to kill Kitana, 
but just then, Kitana presses a very pathetic-looking button, which causes the 
floor to open, and Mileena falls to her death. Now Kitana will rule in true 
peace.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="kunglao">
<img border="1" src="bio_kung_lao.jpg" alt="Kung Lao" title="Kung Lao" width="89" height="82"></a>
<b>Kung Lao</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Kitana and Goro are seen in a large room with a large window pane revealing the 
distant sun. Kitana coerces Goro to sign a treaty of peace with the Centaurs. 
The Centaurs and the Shokan with peace would greatly benefit all innocent lives 
of Earthrealm and other realms, so the Edenians could prevail in bettering all 
realms. Goro concedes, and agrees to a truce with the Centaurs. Kitana, pleased, 
comforts Goro. At that instant, a razor hat is seen slicing Goro across the 
chest. Kung Lao flips down to the floor on which Goro lies. Goro stands, and 
prepares to kill Lao out of retaliatory rage. Kung Lao gestures for peace. After 
explaining how that blow was only out of vengeance, the two unite and shake 
hands.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="mileena">
<img border="1" src="bio_mileena.jpg" alt="Mileena" title="Mileena" width="89" height="82"></a>
<b>Mileena</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
Kitana is seen in a gigantic throne room, virtually exactly alike that of Quan 
Chi's throne room. Kitana, sitting in the throne, is interrupted by her 
synthetic sister, Mileena, whom just then entered the room. The two argue, and 
Mileena reveals how she yearns to murder her &quot;sister&quot; and rule all realms for 
her own, and in the name of Outworld. Kitana explains how she is not her real 
sister, but a product of Shang Tsung for Shao Kahn. Mileena grieves, and then 
uses that as a trick to uppercut Kitana back into her throne in the corner. The 
two argue and Mileena draws her Sais. After more arguing, Mileena throws her 
Sais and knocks Kitana through the window as she falls to the very bottom of the 
tower to her death. Now Mileena will rule all realms.<hr color="#333333">

<b>Jarek</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">
After Shinnok is destroyed by the &quot;good guys&quot;, Sonya confronts Jarek close to a 
huge cliff, and attempts to escort him back to the Earthrealm where he will most 
likely be put into custody of the authorities. Jarek refuses, attempts to ambush 
Sonya, but ultimately throws himself off the cliff. Afterwards, Sonya radios Jax 
and informs him that she's returning to base, but Jarek makes his way back up 
the side of the cliff, throws Sonya to her death, then destroys Sonya's Radio 
before leaving.<hr color="#333333">

throat and lifts him over the cliff. Jarek pleads for his life, but Jax has had 
enough of his whimpering, and lets go. Jarek falls to his death.<hr color="#333333">
