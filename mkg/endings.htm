<img alt="Baraka" border="1" height="82" src="bio_baraka.jpg" title="Baraka" width="89"></a>
<b>Baraka</b><hr class="sub">

Quan Chi is seen in the throne room of the Brotherhood of the Shadow, sifting his 
hands through the lifeless air and flourishing in his own raw sorcery. A knock is 
heard on the gigantic door countless meters away. Quan Chi orders him to enter, 
and we then see it is Baraka who searches Quan Chi. The two then converse and embrace 
as they are planned to rule all realms together, since Baraka is the victor of the 
Tournament. Baraka does not like the idea of having a superior, so he lunges into 
Quan Chi with his long, sharp blades. The blade protrudes into the solar plexus 
of Quan Chi, but the head of Quan Chi becomes, oddly, a skull. Baraka soon finds 
that the real Quan Chi appears behind him. Shocked, Baraka leaps again at the real 
Quan Chi, but is frozen in a maelstrom of pure chaos in mid air, and then disintegrated 
in but a breath.<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="cyrax">
<img alt="Cyrax" border="1" height="82" src="bio_cyrax.jpg" title="Cyrax" width="89"></a>
<b>Cyrax</b><hr class="sub">

Cyrax is seen in a laboratory with Sonya and Jax. Sonya and Jax converse with him, 
and reveal that Cyrax plans to revert back to his human form, before he was violated 
into a cyborg by his fellow Lin Kuei. After Sonya and Jax flip a series of switches 
and commands, Cyrax removes his helmet, and is seen to be fully human once again. 
For this, Cyrax now serves the Special Forces.<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="kitana">
<img alt="Kitana" border="1" height="82" src="bio_kitana.jpg" title="Kitana" width="89"></a>
<b>Kitana</b><hr class="sub">

Kitana is seen in a gigantic throne room, virtually exactly alike that of Quan Chi's 
throne room. Kitana, sitting in the throne, is interrupted by her synthetic sister, 
Mileena, whom just then entered the room. The two argue, and Mileena reveals how 
she yearns to murder her &quot;sister&quot; and rule all realms for her own, and 
in the name of Outworld. Mileena approaches, ready to kill Kitana, but just then, 
Kitana presses a very pathetic-looking button, which causes the floor to open, and 
Mileena falls to her death. Now Kitana will rule in true peace.<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="kunglao">
<img alt="Kung Lao" border="1" height="82" src="bio_kung_lao.jpg" title="Kung Lao" width="89"></a>
<b>Kung Lao</b><hr class="sub">

Kitana and Goro are seen in a large room with a large window pane revealing the 
distant sun. Kitana coerces Goro to sign a treaty of peace with the Centaurs. The 
Centaurs and the Shokan with peace would greatly benefit all innocent lives of Earthrealm 
and other realms, so the Edenians could prevail in bettering all realms. Goro concedes, 
and agrees to a truce with the Centaurs. Kitana, pleased, comforts Goro. At that 
instant, a razor hat is seen slicing Goro across the chest. Kung Lao flips down 
to the floor on which Goro lies. Goro stands, and prepares to kill Lao out of retaliatory 
rage. Kung Lao gestures for peace. After explaining how that blow was only out of 
vengeance, the two unite and shake hands.<hr class="main">

<a href="#top" name="mileena">
<img alt="Mileena" border="1" height="82" src="bio_mileena.jpg" title="Mileena" width="89"></a>
<b>Mileena</b><hr class="sub">

Kitana is seen in a gigantic throne room, virtually exactly alike that of Quan Chi's 
throne room. Kitana, sitting in the throne, is interrupted by her synthetic sister, 
Mileena, whom just then entered the room. The two argue, and Mileena reveals how 
she yearns to murder her &quot;sister&quot; and rule all realms for her own, and 
in the name of Outworld. Kitana explains how she is not her real sister, but a product 
of Shang Tsung for Shao Kahn. Mileena grieves, and then uses that as a trick to 
uppercut Kitana back into her throne in the corner. The two argue and Mileena draws 
her Sais. After more arguing, Mileena throws her Sais and knocks Kitana through 
the window as she falls to the very bottom of the tower to her death. Now Mileena 
will rule all realms.<hr class="main">

After Shinnok is destroyed by the &quot;good guys&quot;, Sonya confronts Jarek close 
to a huge cliff, and attempts to escort him back to the Earthrealm where he will

Sonya, but ultimately throws himself off the cliff. Afterwards, Sonya radios Jax

side of the cliff, throws Sonya to her death, then destroys Sonya's Radio before
