"Kronika's power was mine, mine to share with the tribe!<br>
In the new timeline I built, Tarkatans would be slaves no more. We would rule!<br>
We easily took Edenia, then Outworld and the Netherrealm. Last, we challenged Earthrealm 
in Mortal Kombat.<br>
Within a thousand years, all realms fell to Tarkatan blades...<br>

"For the second time in my life, I kicked the living shit out of an immortal. My 
prize? The Hourglass.<br>
Now I can change history! Talk about ridonkulous cosmic power.<br>
But despite what you may think about Beverly Hills girls, that is SO not my style.<br>
The Chosen One thing is for the Liu Kangs and Kitanas of the world.<br>
In the next timeline, all I want is to be a model soldier. To command the next generation 
of Special Forces.<br>
We were born to defend Earthrealm!<br>
Just like the heroes that inspired me...my parents.<br>
Okay, so there's one more thing I want: My mom back.<br>
Not just for me, but for dad. He and my mom deserve a happily-ever-after retirement.<br>
We'll never know how different things were the last time around. But we'll be together. 
A family.<br>
And that's all that matters."<hr class="main">

"Though I first denied their truth, eventually I realized the wisdom of Liu Kang's 
words.<br>
There is virtue greater than my mother's desired balance. Good must be allowed to 
flourish.<br>
But no matter how I reshaped time, rooting out evil proved impossible.<br>
Though freed from want, mortals still killed each other. Divided by realm and race, 
they easily justified their hate.<br>
Hubris, greed, envy. To appreciate my gifts, mortals sins must be cleansed.<br>
Which is why I baptize the realms with fire. For eons mortals will battle evil, 
eventually achieving victory.<br>
And when they emerge from the darkness, they will be humbled...<br>
Eager to embrace the light."<hr class="main">

"Vermin.<br>
That is the humanoid word for the Kytinn and our fellow insectoids.<br>
But with the Hourglass, This One can review history and give lie to that myth.<br>
Humanoids live to kill. Without a common enemy to fight, they divide. Destroy each 
other.<br>
Insectoids live to survive. No conflicts divide us. We build upon each other. Kin 
does not kill kin.<br>
So tell This One... Who are the vermin?<br>
Time for This One to write a more just history.<br>
One in which pesky humanoids finally take the places they deserve...<br>
Scrambling beneath our feet."<hr class="main">

from Wickett.<br>
Now that it's done, now what? I don't cotton to being Lord of Time, stuck on some 
island at the edge of nowhere.<br>
No, Erron Black likes being in the thick of it.<br>
Seems to me, time oughta stay all mashed up. It's been a hell of a ride. Gotta keep 
these thrills coming.<br>
Which means makin' sure no one gets a chance to screw this up.<br>
Once the Hourglass gets dumped in the Sea of Blood, ain't no one ever shaping history

And that's just the way I like it."<hr class="main">

"Sub-Zero dismissed me. Raiden dismissed me. They all did, even Kronika.<br>
Until I froze the smug looks off all their faces and became the Lin Kuei's new Grandmaster.<br>
The Hourglass offers even greater prospects. With it, I'll mold history to carve 
my name on everyone's lips.<br>
But even its power has limits. My vision can be upended by people's individual choices.<br>
Unlike Kronika, I won't let these imperfections fester until time itself must be 
restarted.<br>
The Lin Kuei will be my time warriors. Travelling through history, they'll get rid 
of those whose actions threaten my vision.<br>
From now on, no one will overlook my greatness. I'll never be dismissed again."<hr class="main">

"Kronika's endless cycle of rewinding and restarting timelines had destroyed my 
spirit.<br>
But she refused to grant me either freedom or death.<br>
So I took her power to do what she could not. I would create one final, perfect 
timeline. Then, I would rest.<br>
But the task was more difficult than I imagined. Mortals refused to follow the paths 
I set for them.<br>
Timeline after timeline, my frustration grew. I began to understand why Kronika 
had been driven to madness.<br>
Perhaps mortals do not need a Lord of Time.<br>
I will sacrifice my body and my mantle to re-sculpt the Sands so that the Hourglass 
runs itself.<br>
And for the first time in all eternity, I can rest... in peace."<hr class="main">

Killed, made a Revenant, resurrected. Since coming back, Dad's never forgotten the 
things he did for Quan Chi.<br>
I thought with the Hourglass, I could fix all that.<br>
And I can.<br>
Dad won't die in that massacre. He'll never be a Revenant. But turns out, what my 
gut's told me since the start of all this is true.<br>
Dad and mom got together when he was in treatment. He doesn't suffer, they don't 
meet. And I'll never be born.<br>
And you know what? I'm good with that.<br>
I'm not just protecting Dad. I'm protecting everyone he'll risk his life to save. 
In my shoes, it's what he would do. It's what a Briggs does.<br>
I know you'll never hear this, but goodbye Dad.<br>

restored - my lover, Kotal, or my loyal friend, Kitana?<br>
I heard Kotal's voice call out to me--<br>
Follow your heart, Jade.<br>
So I let my heart lead, and it took me to an unexpected place... a faint memory 
of home and...<br>
My mother.<br>
I restored my parents and Edenia, building a new era without Shao Kahn! And what 
a happy childhood I enjoyed...<br>
But as I matured, I sensed that I was no ordinary child. Kronika's power dwelled 
within me...<br>
Calling me to a higher purpose.<br>
When I came of age, I ascended to godhood as the Protector of Edenia. Armed with 
the knowledge of past timelines, I challenged Shinnok and Cetrion.<br>
Without Kronika's children pitting the realms against each other, all could be at 
peace. And remain so, under my watchful eyes."<hr class="main">

Raiden warns me, I can't fix everything. Change too much and I could lose Vera. 
Lose Jacqui.<br>
But this power's bigger than us. If I think only about helping myself, what kind 
of officer am I? What kind of man?<br>
I've been lucky. My family and I have lived the American Dream.<br>
But most people who look like me haven't had that chance. I owe it to them to put 
things right.<br>
And I'm not waiting centuries for people to get woke, when I've got the power to 
speed things up.<br>
I don't get it right the first time. Or the second. Or even the third.<br>
But eventually, I knock it out of the damn park. My family's back. The world's a 
better place for everyone.<br>
Turns out you CAN have everything. Anyone who says you can't, needs to dream bigger."<hr class="main">

"This whole adventure? Capital &quot;I&quot; insane.<br>
I marry Sonya? Have a kid who actually likes me? Enquiring minds want to know how 
the hell that happens!<br>
So I get the Hourglass to show me how kicking Shinnok's ass, which I did beautifully, 
turned me from Hollywood mega-star into global icon. So far, so good.<br>
Until I let that fame screw me up. Didn't hit rock bottom until I saw just how badly 
I'd let down my little girl.<br>
I finally got what Old Man Me was saying about needing humility and maturity. But 
I also knew I couldn't get there without living the same life he did.<br>
So I restored the timeline, just as it was.<br>
With one, tiny little difference...<br>
Sonya's story won't end underneath the rubble of some busted-up Netherrealm castle. 
Because Johnny Cage flicks always have happy endings."<hr class="main">

Well let me tell ya, this job sucks. There's no pay, no weekends, and your shift 
lasts forever.<br>
The only smart play is to turn back time and give it back to Kronika.<br>
Bet your ass she's grateful, too!<br>
I didn't ask her for much. Just a chance to take out anyone who's ever tried to 
burn me.<br>
Black Dragon was always more of a &quot;gig&quot; than a brotherhood, anyway.<br>
Now I get to live large, enjoying the simple life of a well-to-do family man.<br>
And if Shao Kahn or Shinnok ever come knocking, my family and I'll take em down.

Oh ho ho, fuck yeah.<br>
I set it up so that everything came up aces. Every desire, every wish, every whim 
I ever had? Done and done.<br>
But I realized pretty quick I'd sucked the fun out of things. Without a fight, winning 
was worthless.<br>
Nah, the fun wasn't in the having. It was in the getting.<br>

Experiencing Edenia's verdant lands for the first time... I've never felt such joy.<br>
But that joy was short-lived.<br>
Edenia's traditions, its languages, its culture. All were completely foreign, having 
been forbidden to me by Shao Kahn. I fit in with my people no better than a Tarkatan.<br>
The truth was hard. Though Edenian by blood, I am not an Edenian.<br>
I am an Outworlder.<br>
Not only that, I am Outworld's Kahn.<br>
I will use ancient Edenian teachings to make myself a better sovereign.<br>

Not that my Naknadan brothers and sisters joined arms to help me. No, every great

I do not wait for handouts. I take what I desire.<br>

With Jade as my queen, I would rule an eternal Osh-Tekk empire that spanned all 
the realms.<br>
But Kronika never understood the Osh-Tekk heart. Our lives are cloth, woven from 
choice and circumstance.<br>
Pull even one thread, that cloth is torn asunder and made worthless.<br>
Now that I am tasked with keeping time, others beg me to have their histories rewritten.<br>
But as long as the Hourglass is mine, I will not shape destiny in any one being's

History will play out as determined by its players.<br>

My nose rubbed in my own fallibility, I was humbled. How could I be worthy to accept 
the mantle as Keeper of Time?<br>
I thought that to control time and destiny fairly, I must purge myself of all human 
emotion.<br>
Summoning the strongest magic, I burned away my fear and anger. All that remained 
was pure logic.<br>
But I learned quickly that the logical choice is often not the just choice.<br>
Unless tempered by compassion and heart, logic leads to decisions no better than 
those based on anger or fear.<br>

It's my duty to take out these ancient, all-powerful beings. But to do that, I need 
an elite squad of immortal gods.<br>
Turns out to make a new god, you've gotta destroy an old one. So I hunt the oldest 
I can find, an omni-deity from a forgotten, unpronounceably-named realm.<br>
It's the fight of my life. But I've got something this god doesn't: family.<br>
In my past, these were the people who mattered most. Now, they're my God Squad.<br>
My daughter.<br>
My brother-in-arms.<br>
My god-daughter.<br>
Yep. Even Johnny.<br>
But only because Cassie insisted. And maybe I missed him a little. Just don't let 
him know that."<hr class="main">

"Once I gained the Hourglass, my first thought was to re-write history and redeem 
the Lin Kuei's honor.<br>
But then I thought of Bi-Han, his life consumed by evil. Before I could redeem my 
clan, I had to redeem my brother.<br>
With the Hourglass, I wound back time to our childhood. I studied every second of 
Bi-Han's life to understand why...<br>
Why he embraced Sektor's corruption. Why he reveled in the vile power given to him 
by Quan Chi.<br>
Armed with that knowledge, I re-sculpted the Sands of Time. I changed Bi-Han's life 
and unfroze his heart.<br>
Now we are comrades, not rivals. Together, as joint Grandmasters, we lead the Lin 
Kuei in defense of Earthrealm."<hr class="main">

Had I not spent centuries mastering the dark powers beyond the grasp of ordinary

Now I am the master of time and fate.<br>
But Kronika's fall proves that even Titans can be defeated.<br>
Though my power lets me roam infinite timelines and feast upon the souls of billions, 
I am vulnerable.<br>
To survive, I must return to the shadows, avoid confrontation, and work my will 
through the hands of others...<br>
More specifically, through the hands of my fellow Titans...<br>
These monstrous beings are plied easily by appealing their greed, vanity, and fear.<br>
Through them, every soul in eternity bends to my influence.<br>

Born into poverty, I resented my ancestors for giving up our future to colonizers...<br>
Kano offered a way out, promising riches if I stole my tribe's most sacred relics.<br>
I was sorely tempted, but then I realized that by saving myself, I'd be surrendering 
the last of my people's dignity.<br>
For the first time, I defended the Matoka's pride.<br>
Kano was unimpressed.<br>
But as I lay dying, the Great Spirit came to me.<br>
By rejecting Kano, I had proven worthy of an ancient honor. The mantle of Nightwolf... 
legendary defender of the Matoka.<br>
Now, as I inherit Kronika's mantle, the way before me is split.<br>
The Keeper of Time cannot also be my tribe's defender. Which path do I chose?<br>
Even here, at time's beginning, the Great Spirit's wisdom guides me. She calls me 
to restore history.<br>
The Matoka, I must leave to another.<br>

"It was an epic accident that brought the Terminator here, rather than to his own 
Earth's past.<br>
But it didn't take long for him to adapt.<br>
He figured that terminating Kronika, and taking her Hourglass, gave him the best 
chance at achieving his mission objective.<br>
Destroying humanity so that the machines prevail.<br>
Turns out the Hourglass wasn't the ultimate weapon.<br>
No matter how many times the Terminator re-booted history, the war between humans 
and the machines always ended the same.<br>
With their mutual destruction.<br>
He realized this war was a losing game.<br>
The only way to win, was not to play.<br>
So the Terminator used the Hourglass to build a future where machines and humans 
don't fight, they cooperate.<br>
The Terminator knew that to preserve this future, no one else could learn about 
the Hourglass.<br>
The information stored in his machine mind was dangerous.<br>
It had to be eliminated.<br>
That's why the Terminator threw himself into the infinite depths of the Sea of Blood.<br>
No one would ever find him, or unlock the Hourglass' secrets.<br>
If you could ask him about it, he'd tell you he made the only logical choice.<br>
