Every character (Minus Shang Tsung/DLC) has 2 Fatalities listed. You can perform

Thank everyone so much for spotting and reporting corrections to MKKomplete, I 
apologize for how long it took me to make corrections to the site. I needed a 
day to myself to go through the emails, make notes, test the inputs and then 
make changes and upload. Again, if you notice anything incorrect, out of place, 
or you have info that I'm missing, Please <a href="mailto:trav.lane84@gmail.com">

Special 56 Pepoles Update:</a> I made a guide for this game... I'm not quite 
sure why myself. Enjoy... I guess??? LOL.<hr color="#333333">
03/08/19 - With Mortal Kombat 11's arrival growing ever closer, I've been 
wanting to update/correct/add certain sections of the site. My energy and 
productivity levels have been super low lately, however I woke up feeling pretty 
decent today, so I managed to get a bit of work done on the site, specifically 
adding &quot;Fatalities/Finishers&quot; sections for some of the older titles, for users 
who just need/want information only pertaining to Fatality Inputs. I've also 
been doing work to some of the coding and formatting to the site, making 
everything look and work better. Thanks to everyone's suggestions and comments. 
If it feels like I haven't gotten to/addressed those comments yet... I'm working 
on it. Thanks again.<hr color="#333333">
03/06/19 - <a target="_blank" href="mk11/default.htm">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
Added 8 characters to Confirmed section of MK11 page. We've been sitting on 
these characters for some time, wanted to make sure we had visual confirmation 
of their inclusion before confirming.<hr color="#333333">
03/01/19 - <a target="_blank" href="mk11/default.htm">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
Added some more currently Unconfirmed characters to the MK11 page, I'm sure 
everyone has seen the newest batch of leaks. They look legit, but having been 
burnt for a few supposed MK11 leaks in the past, I'm trying to be extremely 
careful about what I label as <b>Confirmed</b> or Not. Entirely for accuracy's 
sake.<hr color="#333333">

Johnny Cage Konfirmed!<hr color="#333333">
02/23/19 - Just a small note, the site celebrated it's 17th Birthday on the 15th 
of this month. Wow. We've been at it a long time! For those that don't know, we 
started off as the &quot;Unofficial Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance Strategy Guide&quot; 
site in 2002/2003, somewhere around there. Then when Deception was coming out we 
decided to expand and we renamed the site &quot;Mortal Kombat: Komplete Strategy 
Guide&quot; or &quot;MKKSG&quot; for short. I was doing this for fun, I was like 17 or 18 when 
I started, I basically just wanted it up for myself, I wasn't expecting anybody 
else to take interest in the site, if it helped out other people great, but it 
was a side project, a hobby. And it still is to a degree, but I want to treat it 
as professionally as possible without it feeling like work... Anyway... I wanted 
the name to describe what it is we did, to let people find us easier. Now with 
the size of the site, people are finding it by looking up their favorite MK 
games. So a large or descriptive name is kind of redundant. So we're going to 
shorten it again. Some of you may have seen this coming. We're officially 
renaming the site &quot;Mortal Kombat Komplete&quot; or &quot;MKKomplete&quot; for short. If you're 
a longtime fan, thank you for being with us through this journey. If you're a 
new visitor, feel free to share the site with anyone you think would be 
interested in our content. Thank You.<hr color="#333333">

The Reveal Livestream:

01/11/19 - <a target="_blank" href="mk11/default.htm">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
I've updated the MK11 info page with everything confirmed so far, and from 2 
supposed leaks that had very similar info that at least looked legit. Take every 
character listed under or as &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; with a grain of salt. If one of your 
favorite characters is listed as &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; and they don't make it into the 
final game, don't hate me. I just report on what I see. The community reveal 
event on the 17th of this month is supposed to have an &quot;official unveiling of 
game-play footage and new character introductions&quot;, so perhaps more light will 
be shed on the official roster on that day.<hr color="#333333">

12/14/18 - <a target="_blank" href="mk11/default.htm">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
I've been adding information on MK11 as I've come across it. So far we have 4 
confirmed characters, 1 confirmed DLC/Pre-Order character with 6 additional DLC 
character slots, as of right now 4 Unconfirmed but highly possible characters, 
and 15 characters listed from a supposed leak that I felt had a lot of 
legitimacy to it.<hr color="#333333">
12/07/18 - <a target="_blank" href="mk11/default.htm">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
Mortal Kombat 11 officially revealed! Check out the trailer on YouTube now if 
you haven't!<hr color="#333333">

YouTube:</a> I've been working on Video Game playthroughs on YouTube. I have 
runs up for
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMrnHqby_hI&t=6s">
Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2T4xOcMHKo&t=610s">
Mortal Kombat: Special Forces</a> already. I'm planning on doing more runs (MK 
and Otherwise) by myself and with a few of my friends. It's very low budget, but 
it is fun to work on. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, feel 
free to check us out and/or share with friends that may be interested. Thank you 
for your continued support in this site.<hr color="#333333">
05/31/18 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/abilities.htm">Injustice 2 
Update:</a> Thanks to my buddy Chip I have added an Abilities List section for 
Injustice 2.<hr color="#333333">
04/03/18 - <a target="_blank" href="mk11/default.htm">Mortal Kombat XI Update:</a> 
I've added a Mortal Kombat XI section, but don't get too excited, as the game 
hasn't even been officially announced. I'm simply adding this in case the game 
gets confirmed in the following months. I promise you fans, and anybody familiar 
with my track record of accurately following MK info as it is announced that 
this guide will be no different. Anything you see on the site should be accurate 
and confirmed, and honestly anything you read elsewhere unless reported by 
reputable sources can be taken with a grain of salt.<br>
As of this moment no conclusive or verified info on Mortal Kombat XI even 
exists.<hr color="#333333">
02/13/18 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
I've added the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' info to the site. I decided to give 
each turtle their own section. The four play very similar and share a decent 
portion of moves, however they have enough differences for me to warrant doing 
so. Enjoy. TURTLE POWER!<hr color="#333333">
02/13/18 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are now available for download. I have all of their 
moves documented, however I have yet to update the site. This info will be 
available on the site hopefully later today.<hr color="#333333">
02/07/18 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles official biography updated.<hr color="#333333">
01/09/18 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
I've added Enchantress' info to the site.<hr color="#333333">
01/05/18 - <a target="_blank" href="injustice2/default.htm">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Enchantress' official biography and character art updated. Her release date has 
been confirmed as well for January 9th 2018 with Season Pass and January 16th 
2018 without. I'm also working on fixing some lingering errors with the site. 
Updating is going to be a pain, I can't get FTP to work. I considered changing 
web-hosts but I've been here so long I want to stay as long as I can... Either 
way, big updates/changes are a comin'.<hr color="#333333">
