Every character (Minus Shang Tsung/DLC) has 2 Fatalities listed. You can perform 
Fatalities you haven't unlocked in the Krypt, but it's unknown if you can perform 
Brutalities that you haven't unlocked yet.<hr class="main">

Working on updating/cleaning up sections that I've been meaning to work on for some

combo is incomplete, please notify me. I'm working on more sections but it takes 
time, so bear with me. Also I'm doing play-throughs of the classic 2D Mortal Kombat 
games, starting <a href="https://youtu.be/CKjtgrlveS4" target="_blank">April 15th

Thank everyone so much for spotting and reporting corrections to MKKomplete, I apologize 
for how long it took me to make corrections to the site. I needed a day to myself 
to go through the emails, make notes, test the inputs and then make changes and 
upload. Again, if you notice anything incorrect, out of place, or you have info 
that I'm missing, Please <a href="mailto:trav.lane84@gmail.com">e-mail and inform 
me</a>. I would greatly appreciate it.<hr class="main">

03/08/19 - With Mortal Kombat 11's arrival growing ever closer, I've been wanting 
to update/correct/add certain sections of the site. My energy and productivity levels 
have been super low lately, however I woke up feeling pretty decent today, so I 
managed to get a bit of work done on the site, specifically adding &quot;Fatalities/Finishers&quot; 
sections for some of the older titles, for users who just need/want information 
only pertaining to Fatality Inputs. I've also been doing work to some of the coding 
and formatting to the site, making everything look and work better. Thanks to everyone's 
suggestions and comments. If it feels like I haven't gotten to/addressed those comments 
yet... I'm working on it. Thanks again.<hr class="main">

03/06/19 - <a href="mk11/default.htm" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
Added 8 characters to Confirmed section of MK11 page. We've been sitting on these 
characters for some time, wanted to make sure we had visual confirmation of their 
inclusion before confirming.<hr class="main">

03/01/19 - <a href="mk11/default.htm" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
Added some more currently Unconfirmed characters to the MK11 page, I'm sure everyone 
has seen the newest batch of leaks. They look legit, but having been burnt for a 
few supposed MK11 leaks in the past, I'm trying to be extremely careful about what 
I label as <b>Confirmed</b> or Not. Entirely for accuracy's sake.<hr class="main">

02/23/19 - Just a small note, the site celebrated it's 17th Birthday on the 15th 
of this month. Wow. We've been at it a long time! For those that don't know, we 
started off as the &quot;Unofficial Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance Strategy Guide&quot; 
site in 2002/2003, somewhere around there. Then when Deception was coming out we 
decided to expand and we renamed the site &quot;Mortal Kombat: Komplete Strategy 
Guide&quot; or &quot;MKKSG&quot; for short. I was doing this for fun, I was like 
17 or 18 when I started, I basically just wanted it up for myself, I wasn't expecting 
anybody else to take interest in the site, if it helped out other people great, 
but it was a side project, a hobby. And it still is to a degree, but I want to treat 
it as professionally as possible without it feeling like work... Anyway... I wanted 
the name to describe what it is we did, to let people find us easier. Now with the 
size of the site, people are finding it by looking up their favorite MK games. So 
a large or descriptive name is kind of redundant. So we're going to shorten it again. 
Some of you may have seen this coming. We're officially renaming the site &quot;Mortal 
Kombat Komplete&quot; or &quot;MKKomplete&quot; for short. If you're a longtime 
fan, thank you for being with us through this journey. If you're a new visitor, 
feel free to share the site with anyone you think would be interested in our content. 
Thank You.<hr class="main">

The Reveal Livestream:
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/netherrealm" target="_blank">Twitch</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPlfDssYNtw&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">YouTube</a> 
around 1:30pm EST.<hr class="main">

01/11/19 - <a href="mk11/default.htm" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
I've updated the MK11 info page with everything confirmed so far, and from 2 supposed 
leaks that had very similar info that at least looked legit. Take every character 
listed under or as &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; with a grain of salt. If one of your 
favorite characters is listed as &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; and they don't make it 
into the final game, don't hate me. I just report on what I see. The community reveal 
event on the 17th of this month is supposed to have an &quot;official unveiling 
of game-play footage and new character introductions&quot;, so perhaps more light 
will be shed on the official roster on that day.<hr class="main">

12/14/18 - <a href="mk11/default.htm" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
I've been adding information on MK11 as I've come across it. So far we have 4 confirmed 
characters, 1 confirmed DLC/Pre-Order character with 6 additional DLC character 
slots, as of right now 4 Unconfirmed but highly possible characters, and 15 characters 
listed from a supposed leak that I felt had a lot of legitimacy to it.<hr class="main">

12/07/18 - <a href="mk11/default.htm" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat 11 Update:</a> 
Mortal Kombat 11 officially revealed! Check out the trailer on YouTube now if you 
haven't!<hr class="main">

06/05/18 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/icemantraveler" target="_blank">
YouTube:</a> I've been working on Video Game playthroughs on YouTube. I have runs 
up for
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMrnHqby_hI&amp;t=6s" target="_blank">Mortal 
Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2T4xOcMHKo&amp;t=610s" target="_blank">
Mortal Kombat: Special Forces</a> already. I'm planning on doing more runs (MK and 
Otherwise) by myself and with a few of my friends. It's very low budget, but it 
is fun to work on. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, feel free 
to check us out and/or share with friends that may be interested. Thank you for 
your continued support in this site.<hr class="main">

05/31/18 - <a href="injustice2/abilities.htm" target="_blank">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Thanks to my buddy Chip I have added an Abilities List section for Injustice 2.<hr class="main">

04/03/18 - <a href="mk11/default.htm" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat XI Update:</a> 
I've added a Mortal Kombat XI section, but don't get too excited, as the game hasn't 
even been officially announced. I'm simply adding this in case the game gets confirmed 
in the following months. I promise you fans, and anybody familiar with my track 
record of accurately following MK info as it is announced that this guide will be 
no different. Anything you see on the site should be accurate and confirmed, and 
honestly anything you read elsewhere unless reported by reputable sources can be 
taken with a grain of salt.<br>
As of this moment no conclusive or verified info on Mortal Kombat XI even exists.<hr class="main">

02/13/18 - <a href="injustice2/default.htm" target="_blank">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
I've added the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' info to the site. I decided to give 
each turtle their own section. The four play very similar and share a decent portion 
of moves, however they have enough differences for me to warrant doing so. Enjoy. 
TURTLE POWER!<hr class="main">

02/13/18 - <a href="injustice2/default.htm" target="_blank">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are now available for download. I have all of their 
moves documented, however I have yet to update the site. This info will be available 
on the site hopefully later today.<hr class="main">

02/07/18 - <a href="injustice2/default.htm" target="_blank">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles official biography updated.<hr class="main">

01/09/18 - <a href="injustice2/default.htm" target="_blank">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
I've added Enchantress' info to the site.<hr class="main">

01/05/18 - <a href="injustice2/default.htm" target="_blank">Injustice 2 Update:</a> 
Enchantress' official biography and character art updated. Her release date has 
been confirmed as well for January 9th 2018 with Season Pass and January 16th 2018 
without. I'm also working on fixing some lingering errors with the site. Updating 
is going to be a pain, I can't get FTP to work. I considered changing web-hosts 
but I've been here so long I want to stay as long as I can... Either way, big updates/changes 
are a comin'.<hr class="main">
