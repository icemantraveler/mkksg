<img alt="Ashrah" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_ashrah.jpg" title="Ashrah" width="75"></a>
<b>Ashrah</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">The power of Blaze purified Ashrah completely; 
she was transformed into a being of divine light.<br>Her radiance soothed even the 
darkest of souls.<br>With new purpose, she traversed the realms in search of evil, 
pacifying the wicked.<br>Her mission came full circle when at last she purified 
the sorcerer who would have her slain: Quan Chi.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="baraka" style="text-decoration: none">
<img alt="Baraka" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_baraka.jpg" title="Baraka" width="75"></a>
<b>Baraka</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">With the power of Blaze within him, Baraka would 
never again serve another.<br>Summoning Shao Kahn and Onaga before him atop the 
pyramid, he gave them a choice: Submit to Lord Baraka or die.<br>They responded 
by attacking the Tarkatan.<br>In a flash, Baraka's blades grew to twice their normal 
length and pierced his former masters through their hearts.<br>Flinging their bodies 
down the side of the pyramid, Baraka turned his attention to a more important matter: 
Who would be his queen?<br>He gave Mileena a choice.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="boraicho">
<img alt="Bo' Rai Cho" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_boraicho.jpg" title="Bo' Rai Cho" width="75"></a>
<b>Bo' Rai Cho</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Upon defeating Blaze, Bo' Rai Cho was transported 
to The Heavens.<br>He stood before me, a humble warrior unsure of his fate in the 
presence of a god.<br>I had looked into his soul and found that he was a good man 
and a powerful warrior.<br>Outworld needed a protector, a task for which Bo' Rai 
Cho had more than proven himself worthy.<br>At my request, the Elder Gods breathed 
their life force into him, transforming the once humble warrior into a god.<br>Bo' 
Rai Cho had become Protector of Outworld.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="chameleon">
<img alt="Chameleon" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_chameleon.jpg" title="Chameleon" width="75"></a>
<b>Chameleon</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">As the battle raged, Chameleon camouflaged himself 
and raced to the top of the pyramid unseen.<br>There he defeated Blaze and the ethereal 
power overtook him.<br>Immortality was now his!<br>Though he had been ever-present 
throughout the crises of the realms, from Liu Kang's first victory to the return 
of the Dragon King, he had remained hidden from sight, waiting for his moment to 
come.<br>That moment had arrived. From this day forth, the realms will know Chameleon 
as the true champion of Mortal Kombat!<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="cyrax">
<img alt="Cyrax" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_cyrax.jpg" title="Cyrax" width="75"></a>
<b>Cyrax</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">When he defeated Blaze, elemental power surged through 
Cyrax and shattered his cybernetics. He was human once again.<br>He allied with 
Sub-Zero and with him confronted the cyborgs Smoke and Sektor.<br>In an epic battle 
of men versus machines, Cyrax and Sub-Zero defeated their longtime foes.<br>The 
cyborgs will be reprogrammed to serve the Lin Kuei once more, until they too can 
be reverted to their human forms.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="dairou">
<img alt="Dairou" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_dairou.jpg" title="Dairou" width="75"></a>
<b>Dairou</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">The fire of Blaze enveloped Dairou and formed around 
him a golden suit of armor.<br>Enraged, Shao Kahn attacked, but the armor scorched 
his body with every blow.<br>Dairou defeated the emperor and claimed Outworld for 
himself.<br>Under his rule, Outworld once again became the majestic realm it had 
been in ages past.<br>Convinced of his good nature, Edenia and Earthrealm forged 
an alliance with Dairou that would ensure peace and stability forever.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="darrius">
<img alt="Darrius" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_darrius.jpg" title="Darrius" width="75"></a>
<b>Darrius</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Upon defeating Blaze, the pyramid shrank and transformed 
into a golden ring.<br>The ring granted Darrius access to my vault, wherein lay 
the treasure rightfully due my sons Taven and Daegon.<br>The powerful artifacts 
allowed Darrius to finally defeat Hotaru and conquer the realm of Order.<br>But 
the items were meant only for my lineage to wield.<br>I have now sent Taven and 
Daegon on yet another quest. They must work together to defeat Darrius and retrieve 
what he has stolen.<hr color="#333333"><a href="#top" name="drahmin">
<img alt="Drahmin" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_drahmin.jpg" title="Drahmin" width="75"></a>
<b>Drahmin</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">The energy of Blaze unlocked the life force residing 
within Drahmin's mask.<br>Unable to remove it, Drahmin became possessed by it and 
grew to three times his original size.<br>The power of the mask also fueled the 
rage within him.<br>Unable to contain his fury, Drahmin turned on his former ally, 
Moloch, in an epic battle of demons.<br>Moloch was defeated, but Drahmin's bloodlust 
has only just begun! <hr color="#333333"><a href="#top" name="ermac">
<img alt="Ermac" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_ermac.jpg" title="Ermac" width="75"></a>
<b>Ermac</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">The energy of Blaze shattered Ermac, separating 
him into the many warriors who comprised his being.<br>Now each with his own physical 
form, the Ermacs are linked psychically and act according to their collective consciousness.<br>
No longer a mere fusion of warrior souls, Ermac has become an army.
<hr color="#333333"><a href="#top" name="frost">
<img alt="Frost" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_frost.jpg" title="Frost" width="75"></a>
<b>Frost</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Her strength increased, Frost once again took the 
Dragon Medallion from Sub-Zero and enhanced her freezing power far beyond her former 
mentor's.<br>Traveling to Outworld, she located the tomb of her ancestors, the Cryomancers, 
and planted their souls in the bodies of the current Lin Kuei.<br>Her army of Cryomancers 
conquered the realms, leaving each of them a frozen wasteland.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="fujin">
<img alt="Fujin" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_fujin.jpg" title="Fujin" width="75"></a>
<b>Fujin</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">As the energy of Blaze coursed through Fujin, it 
transformed the wind god into a storm of justice.<br>His power increased exponentially, 
he created a new realm from the shattered remnants of worlds that had fallen victim 
to Shao Kahn's aggression.<br>From there the forces of Light will stage their operations, 
with Kung Lao as Fujin's commanding general.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="goro">
<img alt="Goro" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_goro.jpg" title="Goro" width="75"></a>
<b>Goro</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Having defeated Blaze, Goro had attained the power 
of a god.<br>But to the forces of Darkness, his power was not meant for a mere Shokan 
to wield.<br>Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, Shao Kahn and Onaga all had anticipated victory, 
only to have it stolen from them.<br>The four surrounded Goro in a vain attempt 
to wrest the power from him.<br>Goro laughed, raised his arms and let forth an ancient 
Shokan battle cry.<br>From out of nowhere an army of Shokan warriors stormed the 
pyramid and slaughtered the four attackers.<br>The Shokan race will rule Outworld 
forever!<hr color="#333333"><a href="#top" name="havik">
<img alt="Havik" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_havik.jpg" title="Havik" width="75"></a>
<b>Havik</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Infused with the power of Blaze, the Cleric of Chaos, 
Havik, became Chaos incarnate!<br>His aura corrupted the stability of the realms, 
causing them to rip, tear and reshape in grotesque ways.<br>Soon nothing remained 
that resembled the former universe.<br>Havik's dream had been realized.<br>Ultimate 
Chaos had been achieved.<hr color="#333333"><a href="#top" name="hotaru">
<img alt="Hotaru" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_hotaru.jpg" title="Hotaru" width="75"></a>
<b>Hotaru</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">The power of Blaze transformed Hotaru into a being 
of pure Order.<br>All would bow before him or be transformed by his gaze.<br>Yet 
there was one whom Hotaru would see pay for his crimes against conformity: the Cleric 
of Chaos, Havik!<br>The light of Hotaru poured into Havik's mind and transformed 
him into an agent of Order -- Hotaru's second-in-command!<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="hsuhao">
<img alt="Hsu Hao" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_hsu_hao.jpg" title="Hsu Hao" width="75"></a>
<b>Hsu Hao</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Killed in the shockwave of Blaze's violent death, 
Hsu Hao's corrupt soul descended into the Netherrealm.<br>As his soul began to regain 
a physical body, Hsu Hao became his true self: a demon of emptiness and desolation.<br>
Leading an Oni horde, he defeated Shinnok and his minions.<br>He now sits upon the 
throne of the Netherrealm.<hr color="#333333"><a href="#top" name="jade">
<img alt="Jade" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_jade.jpg" title="Jade" width="75"></a>
<b>Jade</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Defeated, Blaze transferred godlike power to Jade 
and instructed her to make true that which she most desired.<br>As if controlled 
by some divine force, she let out a tremendous shriek that split open the pyramid.<br>
As she inhaled, the forces of Darkness were sucked inside the ancient structure.<br>
It then resealed itself, trapping them there for eternity.<br>Jade was celebrated 
as a hero -- and the pyramid stood as a reminder to those who would threaten Edenia.<hr color="#333333">
<a href="#top" name="jarek">
<img alt="Jarek" border="1" height="75" src="pics/bio_jarek.jpg" title="Jarek" width="75"></a>
<b>Jarek</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">The power of Blaze drew chi from all the kombatants

As Taven battled Blaze, Daegon stabbed the fire elemental from behind with the sword 
I had left him.<br>Thus through treachery did Daegon complete the quest.<br>But 
before he could savor his victory, the pyramid shook and a recess opened, revealing 
the parents he had murdered: Delia and myself.<br>We were in fact still alive, our 
deaths feigned in an elaborate test created to reveal the true nature of our sons.<br>
It is clear that Taven possesses the virtue required to defend Edenia; he will take 
my place as Defender.<br>Daegon, however, will be punished severely for the suffering 
he has caused. <hr color="#333333"><a href="#top" name="taven">

<b>Taven</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Taven finally completed the quest by slaying Blaze 
with the sword I left for him in my temple.<br>As intended, the godlike energy passed 
through him, transforming him into a full god.<br>The surge of power then passed 
through the armor given to him by his mother an was dispersed into every kombatant 
within the crater.<br>The result was intended to strip them of their special powers, 
but Blaze had been corrupted long ago by the Dragon King's holy men.<br>Instead 
of nullifying the kombatants' power, it made them stronger than before!<br>The quest 
was a failure! May the Elder Gods forgive me!<hr color="#333333">

<b>Khameleon</b><hr color="#1A1A1A">Drinking in the power of Blaze, Khameleon's 
eyes glowed as she focused her wrath on Shao Kahn.<br>The emperor would finally 
pay for destroying Zaterra and so too would those who served him.<br>The pain he 
endured during his transformation was excruciating and Shao Kahn for the first time 
in his life pleaded for mercy.<br>She granted him none.<br>Khameleon's power transformed 
Shao Kahn into a Raptor, powerful like her, but subservient to her wishes.<br>She 
then turned her attention to his allies and they too were transformed.<br>But she 
lost control of her new found power and mistakenly mutated the forces of light as 
well.<br>Khameleon now had at her command an army of powerful Raptor warriors.<br>
The might of Zaterra had finally returned.<hr color="#333333">
